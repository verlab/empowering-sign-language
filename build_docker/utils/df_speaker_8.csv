2697;02QGTJlJYnM;02QGTJlJYnM-8-rgb_front;02QGTJlJYnM_10;02QGTJlJYnM_10-8-rgb_front;68.27;72.73;But the nice thing about Pam is that she has light skin.;8;12
2698;02QGTJlJYnM;02QGTJlJYnM-8-rgb_front;02QGTJlJYnM_11;02QGTJlJYnM_11-8-rgb_front;73.01;74.91;So this would work on a laser.;8;7
2699;02QGTJlJYnM;02QGTJlJYnM-8-rgb_front;02QGTJlJYnM_12;02QGTJlJYnM_12-8-rgb_front;74.91;80.05;But not at the best potential like a white skinned person and a dark, dark haired person.;8;17
2700;02QGTJlJYnM;02QGTJlJYnM-8-rgb_front;02QGTJlJYnM_13;02QGTJlJYnM_13-8-rgb_front;80.47;82.26;So she wants electrology.;8;4
2701;02QGTJlJYnM;02QGTJlJYnM-8-rgb_front;02QGTJlJYnM_14;02QGTJlJYnM_14-8-rgb_front;82.26;83.46;She really believes in it.;8;5
2702;02QGTJlJYnM;02QGTJlJYnM-8-rgb_front;02QGTJlJYnM_15;02QGTJlJYnM_15-8-rgb_front;83.46;87.03;She's had great success with it and that's what we're going to do.;8;13
2703;02QGTJlJYnM;02QGTJlJYnM-8-rgb_front;02QGTJlJYnM_16;02QGTJlJYnM_16-8-rgb_front;87.39;93.82;So now we're just going to slide each one of these down, this probe, down each one of these follicles.;8;20
2704;02QGTJlJYnM;02QGTJlJYnM-8-rgb_front;02QGTJlJYnM_17;02QGTJlJYnM_17-8-rgb_front;94.34;96.0;And this hair is a little heavier.;8;7
2705;02QGTJlJYnM;02QGTJlJYnM-8-rgb_front;02QGTJlJYnM_18;02QGTJlJYnM_18-8-rgb_front;96.0;98.67;And this is they call terminal sexual hair.;8;8
2706;02QGTJlJYnM;02QGTJlJYnM-8-rgb_front;02QGTJlJYnM_19;02QGTJlJYnM_19-8-rgb_front;98.98;101.01;It's deeper and it's a little stronger.;8;7
2707;02QGTJlJYnM;02QGTJlJYnM-8-rgb_front;02QGTJlJYnM_2;02QGTJlJYnM_2-8-rgb_front;12.98;23.9;And when the hair is dark, like I said before, I'm going to tell them I think, and this is my opinion, I think laser is going to be the better choice for you.;8;34
2708;02QGTJlJYnM;02QGTJlJYnM-8-rgb_front;02QGTJlJYnM_20;02QGTJlJYnM_20-8-rgb_front;101.01;107.43;As you can see if I was to hold up that hair, that it's deeper than a lot of the other hairs in the body.;8;25
2709;02QGTJlJYnM;02QGTJlJYnM-8-rgb_front;02QGTJlJYnM_21;02QGTJlJYnM_21-8-rgb_front;107.85;117.1;If you measure on the probe how deep it is, so that tells you just how deep your insertion should be.;8;21
2710;02QGTJlJYnM;02QGTJlJYnM-8-rgb_front;02QGTJlJYnM_3;02QGTJlJYnM_3-8-rgb_front;24.34;33.86;But when it's a woman that has sporadic hair on the side or here and there, strays and some cleanup work, I would advise electrology.;8;25
2711;02QGTJlJYnM;02QGTJlJYnM-8-rgb_front;02QGTJlJYnM_4;02QGTJlJYnM_4-8-rgb_front;34.14;41.35;And especially if that hair is light in color because energy of a laser is not going to work on lighter hair.;8;22
2712;02QGTJlJYnM;02QGTJlJYnM-8-rgb_front;02QGTJlJYnM_5;02QGTJlJYnM_5-8-rgb_front;41.35;51.03;It doesn't have the melanin for the laser to be attracted to it and cause the heat to go into the follicle and destroy the germitive cells.;8;27
2713;02QGTJlJYnM;02QGTJlJYnM-8-rgb_front;02QGTJlJYnM_6;02QGTJlJYnM_6-8-rgb_front;51.36;57.5;But when it comes to electrology, each hair no matter what the color is, it's going to work on.;8;19
2714;02QGTJlJYnM;02QGTJlJYnM-8-rgb_front;02QGTJlJYnM_7;02QGTJlJYnM_7-8-rgb_front;57.8;62.68;So in that fashion we're going to go in and we're going to look, assess the area.;8;17
2715;02QGTJlJYnM;02QGTJlJYnM-8-rgb_front;02QGTJlJYnM_8;02QGTJlJYnM_8-8-rgb_front;63.36;65.64;Pam's hair is not very dark.;8;6
2716;02QGTJlJYnM;02QGTJlJYnM-8-rgb_front;02QGTJlJYnM_9;02QGTJlJYnM_9-8-rgb_front;65.64;67.98;It really is kind of a dark blonde.;8;8
2717;02WRxAwx-Bo;02WRxAwx-Bo-8-rgb_front;02WRxAwx-Bo_1;02WRxAwx-Bo_1-8-rgb_front;11.1;14.42;Now, I'm going to show you how to make one of my favorite holiday punches.;8;15
2718;02WRxAwx-Bo;02WRxAwx-Bo-8-rgb_front;02WRxAwx-Bo_10;02WRxAwx-Bo_10-8-rgb_front;64.63;66.3;And, we're going to get our wooden spoon.;8;8
2719;02WRxAwx-Bo;02WRxAwx-Bo-8-rgb_front;02WRxAwx-Bo_11;02WRxAwx-Bo_11-8-rgb_front;67.01;68.93;Just mix all of the ingredients together.;8;7
2720;02WRxAwx-Bo;02WRxAwx-Bo-8-rgb_front;02WRxAwx-Bo_12;02WRxAwx-Bo_12-8-rgb_front;69.69;71.55;So, you can get acquainted with one another.;8;8
2721;02WRxAwx-Bo;02WRxAwx-Bo-8-rgb_front;02WRxAwx-Bo_13;02WRxAwx-Bo_13-8-rgb_front;73.09;79.99;And, we're going to take it over to our stove top where our sauce pan will be ready to go and on medium.;8;23
2722;02WRxAwx-Bo;02WRxAwx-Bo-8-rgb_front;02WRxAwx-Bo_14;02WRxAwx-Bo_14-8-rgb_front;81.49;82.76;Let's go over there.;8;4
2723;02WRxAwx-Bo;02WRxAwx-Bo-8-rgb_front;02WRxAwx-Bo_15;02WRxAwx-Bo_15-8-rgb_front;87.91;94.38;So, in the pan we're going to be heating our four cups of cranberry juice with the cloves, the hint of nutmeg and the cinnamon sticks.;8;26
2724;02WRxAwx-Bo;02WRxAwx-Bo-8-rgb_front;02WRxAwx-Bo_16;02WRxAwx-Bo_16-8-rgb_front;94.43;97.34;And, we're going to add some honey.;8;7
2725;02WRxAwx-Bo;02WRxAwx-Bo-8-rgb_front;02WRxAwx-Bo_17;02WRxAwx-Bo_17-8-rgb_front;98.77;103.87;We need to make sure that we stir until the honey as completely dissolved.;8;14
2726;02WRxAwx-Bo;02WRxAwx-Bo-8-rgb_front;02WRxAwx-Bo_18;02WRxAwx-Bo_18-8-rgb_front;104.52;107.58;And, of course the juice is nice and warm.;8;9
2727;02WRxAwx-Bo;02WRxAwx-Bo-8-rgb_front;02WRxAwx-Bo_19;02WRxAwx-Bo_19-8-rgb_front;108.98;109.85;That should be enough.;8;4
2728;02WRxAwx-Bo;02WRxAwx-Bo-8-rgb_front;02WRxAwx-Bo_2;02WRxAwx-Bo_2-8-rgb_front;14.64;19.42;This is called the non-alcoholic Spiced Punch and it's very quick and easy to make.;8;15
2729;02WRxAwx-Bo;02WRxAwx-Bo-8-rgb_front;02WRxAwx-Bo_20;02WRxAwx-Bo_20-8-rgb_front;111.92;114.63;But, if you like honey, feel free to add a little more.;8;12
2730;02WRxAwx-Bo;02WRxAwx-Bo-8-rgb_front;02WRxAwx-Bo_21;02WRxAwx-Bo_21-8-rgb_front;115.25;130.46;Now, we're going to bring the punch over to our bowl.;8;11
2731;02WRxAwx-Bo;02WRxAwx-Bo-8-rgb_front;02WRxAwx-Bo_22;02WRxAwx-Bo_22-8-rgb_front;131.82;143.4;Make sure you do it very gently, so you don't get burned.;8;12
2732;02WRxAwx-Bo;02WRxAwx-Bo-8-rgb_front;02WRxAwx-Bo_23;02WRxAwx-Bo_23-8-rgb_front;144.76;147.94;The non-alcoholic Spiced Punch serves six to eight people.;8;9
2733;02WRxAwx-Bo;02WRxAwx-Bo-8-rgb_front;02WRxAwx-Bo_24;02WRxAwx-Bo_24-8-rgb_front;148.17;155.75;And, typically it would be served in a mug or a teacup garnished with about two little sticks of cinnamon and that's it.;8;23
2734;02WRxAwx-Bo;02WRxAwx-Bo-8-rgb_front;02WRxAwx-Bo_25;02WRxAwx-Bo_25-8-rgb_front;156.01;157.9;The non-alcoholic Spiced Punch.;8;4

2736;02WRxAwx-Bo;02WRxAwx-Bo-8-rgb_front;02WRxAwx-Bo_4;02WRxAwx-Bo_4-8-rgb_front;20.71;32.58;You're going to need four cups of cranberry juice, honey just for the taste, a few sticks of cinnamon, a pinch of nutmeg and about three to four cloves.;8;29
2737;02WRxAwx-Bo;02WRxAwx-Bo-8-rgb_front;02WRxAwx-Bo_5;02WRxAwx-Bo_5-8-rgb_front;32.88;36.84;Now, I'm going to bring over here my punch bowl to mix all the things in.;8;16
2738;02WRxAwx-Bo;02WRxAwx-Bo-8-rgb_front;02WRxAwx-Bo_6;02WRxAwx-Bo_6-8-rgb_front;37.1;40.29;And, you can start your stove top at about medium.;8;10
2739;02WRxAwx-Bo;02WRxAwx-Bo-8-rgb_front;02WRxAwx-Bo_7;02WRxAwx-Bo_7-8-rgb_front;40.66;52.25;Now, I'm going to mix the two cinnamon sticks with the four cups of cranberry juice.;8;16
2740;02WRxAwx-Bo;02WRxAwx-Bo-8-rgb_front;02WRxAwx-Bo_8;02WRxAwx-Bo_8-8-rgb_front;52.7;61.76;Like I said, just a little hint of nutmeg and a few cloves.;8;13
2741;02WRxAwx-Bo;02WRxAwx-Bo-8-rgb_front;02WRxAwx-Bo_9;02WRxAwx-Bo_9-8-rgb_front;64.14;64.63;Like so.;8;2

2752;02aFykvwx6M;02aFykvwx6M-8-rgb_front;02aFykvwx6M_18;02aFykvwx6M_18-8-rgb_front;82.18;84.93;That's for our superset of burpies and sit-ups.;8;8
2753;02aFykvwx6M;02aFykvwx6M-8-rgb_front;02aFykvwx6M_19;02aFykvwx6M_19-8-rgb_front;84.93;90.82;Next we are going to work on some exercises, single leg exercises that will help develop stability and agility.;8;19
2754;02aFykvwx6M;02aFykvwx6M-8-rgb_front;02aFykvwx6M_2;02aFykvwx6M_2-8-rgb_front;7.98;10.81;Jones is going to demonstrate what a burpie is.;8;9

2756;02aFykvwx6M;02aFykvwx6M-8-rgb_front;02aFykvwx6M_4;02aFykvwx6M_4-8-rgb_front;12.6;24.83;We want to hit the ground and then jump back into a plank position lowered down for a push-up and then we're going to spring forward and then get into a squat, deep squat position and then we finish by ending up on top.;8;44
2757;02aFykvwx6M;02aFykvwx6M-8-rgb_front;02aFykvwx6M_5;02aFykvwx6M_5-8-rgb_front;25.65;29.75;Then we are going to combine that with sit-ups.;8;9

2760;02aFykvwx6M;02aFykvwx6M-8-rgb_front;02aFykvwx6M_8;02aFykvwx6M_8-8-rgb_front;35.8;45.03;We are going to work full sit-ups so that we're getting the hip flexors involved and when we come up on top we open up the chest, open up the shoulders and push the chest out.;8;36
2761;02aFykvwx6M;02aFykvwx6M-8-rgb_front;02aFykvwx6M_9;02aFykvwx6M_9-8-rgb_front;46.18;48.17;Now we are going to work a combination of it.;8;10

2764;02gzHnpz1W4;02gzHnpz1W4-8-rgb_front;02gzHnpz1W4_10;02gzHnpz1W4_10-8-rgb_front;41.1;46.19;Now what I'm going to do is since my overhand loop, my initial loop I created, my working end.;8;19
2765;02gzHnpz1W4;02gzHnpz1W4-8-rgb_front;02gzHnpz1W4_11;02gzHnpz1W4_11-8-rgb_front;46.61;51.67;Bring it back around and create another loop here, another just overhand loop.;8;13
2766;02gzHnpz1W4;02gzHnpz1W4-8-rgb_front;02gzHnpz1W4_12;02gzHnpz1W4_12-8-rgb_front;51.67;56.68;And then I'm going to take my standing end that I have here and we'll bring it back around as well.;8;21
2767;02gzHnpz1W4;02gzHnpz1W4-8-rgb_front;02gzHnpz1W4_13;02gzHnpz1W4_13-8-rgb_front;56.68;60.0;And we'll create another overhand loop as well on the other side.;8;12
2768;02gzHnpz1W4;02gzHnpz1W4-8-rgb_front;02gzHnpz1W4_14;02gzHnpz1W4_14-8-rgb_front;60.67;69.92;Now, how this is going to be used is, I'm going to take my block of wood here, and I'm going to pick both of these pieces up and I'm going to slide my wood through.;8;36
2769;02gzHnpz1W4;02gzHnpz1W4-8-rgb_front;02gzHnpz1W4_15;02gzHnpz1W4_15-8-rgb_front;69.92;72.83;And I'm just going to pull them through, like so.;8;10
2770;02gzHnpz1W4;02gzHnpz1W4-8-rgb_front;02gzHnpz1W4_16;02gzHnpz1W4_16-8-rgb_front;73.73;76.21;And constrict these knots around this piece of wood.;8;9
2771;02gzHnpz1W4;02gzHnpz1W4-8-rgb_front;02gzHnpz1W4_17;02gzHnpz1W4_17-8-rgb_front;76.24;85.19;Now I'll have to work it just a little bit, because there you go, pull.;8;15
2772;02gzHnpz1W4;02gzHnpz1W4-8-rgb_front;02gzHnpz1W4_18;02gzHnpz1W4_18-8-rgb_front;86.8;94.02;My square piece of wood is going to create problems, but if this was a round piece like a broomstick or something, this would actually tighten up a lot tighter.;8;30
2773;02gzHnpz1W4;02gzHnpz1W4-8-rgb_front;02gzHnpz1W4_19;02gzHnpz1W4_19-8-rgb_front;95.61;98.51;Now as you can see here, this is how your figure of eight loop should look.;8;16
2774;02gzHnpz1W4;02gzHnpz1W4-8-rgb_front;02gzHnpz1W4_2;02gzHnpz1W4_2-8-rgb_front;7.86;10.65;It?s used to tie around something, you know if you want to.;8;12
2775;02gzHnpz1W4;02gzHnpz1W4-8-rgb_front;02gzHnpz1W4_20;02gzHnpz1W4_20-8-rgb_front;98.79;103.96;Kind of weaving around, you know, weaving around through and of itself.;8;12
2776;02gzHnpz1W4;02gzHnpz1W4-8-rgb_front;02gzHnpz1W4_21;02gzHnpz1W4_21-8-rgb_front;103.96;106.94;Create this nice constrictor type knot.;8;6

2860;03EzcoSP2pc;03EzcoSP2pc-8-rgb_front;03EzcoSP2pc_14;03EzcoSP2pc_14-8-rgb_front;115.61;122.39;If it does go off the keeper, then the player is allowed to then try to get the rebound into the goal.;8;22
2861;03EzcoSP2pc;03EzcoSP2pc-8-rgb_front;03EzcoSP2pc_15;03EzcoSP2pc_15-8-rgb_front;122.39;129.16;But once it's touched, or once the ball is kicked towards the goal, everybody else is allowed to enter the play of field.;8;23
2862;03EzcoSP2pc;03EzcoSP2pc-8-rgb_front;03EzcoSP2pc_2;03EzcoSP2pc_2-8-rgb_front;7.45;9.69;What I'm going to tell you about is the run up pad.;8;12
2863;03EzcoSP2pc;03EzcoSP2pc-8-rgb_front;03EzcoSP2pc_3;03EzcoSP2pc_3-8-rgb_front;10.37;15.38;Now basically this is very different than the outdoor version of a PK.;8;13
2864;03EzcoSP2pc;03EzcoSP2pc-8-rgb_front;03EzcoSP2pc_4;03EzcoSP2pc_4-8-rgb_front;15.41;24.45;This is when a flagrant foul, usually a blue card style foul, is committed, and there was possibly an offensive chance for a goal.;8;24
2865;03EzcoSP2pc;03EzcoSP2pc-8-rgb_front;03EzcoSP2pc_5;03EzcoSP2pc_5-8-rgb_front;24.95;47.55;So the referee will pull all the players back behind the red line, and the person who gets awarded the kick, gets the ball started at the red line, and the goal keeper has to start with his heels on the goal line, and once the referee blows his whistle, those two can come out, and then it's basically one V one.;8;62
2866;03EzcoSP2pc;03EzcoSP2pc-8-rgb_front;03EzcoSP2pc_6;03EzcoSP2pc_6-8-rgb_front;47.58;58.46;When the shot is taken, if it's missed the play is dead, and I believe the team that was awarded the kick automatically gets a free kick after the PK.;8;30
2867;03EzcoSP2pc;03EzcoSP2pc-8-rgb_front;03EzcoSP2pc_7;03EzcoSP2pc_7-8-rgb_front;59.63;66.08;The other PK is just one of your standard penalty kicks where everybody is placed outside the red line.;8;19
2868;03EzcoSP2pc;03EzcoSP2pc-8-rgb_front;03EzcoSP2pc_8;03EzcoSP2pc_8-8-rgb_front;66.31;71.82;You get one of these kicks when a penalty or a foul occurs inside the goalie box.;8;17
2869;03EzcoSP2pc;03EzcoSP2pc-8-rgb_front;03EzcoSP2pc_9;03EzcoSP2pc_9-8-rgb_front;72.26;77.73;Again it's a smaller goalie box, so these are a little bit rarer than the one V one penalty kicks.;8;20

2902;03WUE9zzQY4;03WUE9zzQY4-8-rgb_front;03WUE9zzQY4_15;03WUE9zzQY4_15-8-rgb_front;54.12;59.68;You don't want to have to spend your whole time doing the figuring getting it right which is why we're going to work on that right now.;8;27

2912;03jABW2MKkk;03jABW2MKkk-8-rgb_front;03jABW2MKkk_0;03jABW2MKkk_0-8-rgb_front;0.54;5.39;Hi, I'm Jay French at jayfrenchstudios.com, and I'm going to show you how to draw clasped hands.;8;17
2913;03jABW2MKkk;03jABW2MKkk-8-rgb_front;03jABW2MKkk_1;03jABW2MKkk_1-8-rgb_front;6.16;18.56;Okay, to draw clasped hands, of course there are many angles you can do this from, we're going to do it from pretty much the forward angle like this, so, what you have is, I'm going to draw the back of the hands.;8;43
2914;03jABW2MKkk;03jABW2MKkk-8-rgb_front;03jABW2MKkk_10;03jABW2MKkk_10-8-rgb_front;78.84;86.88;And that's how to do the clasped hand from that angle until you see just the hint of the pinkie finger there.;8;22
2915;03jABW2MKkk;03jABW2MKkk-8-rgb_front;03jABW2MKkk_11;03jABW2MKkk_11-8-rgb_front;88.96;94.48;Then show your knuckle line, from there you can add shading.;8;11
2916;03jABW2MKkk;03jABW2MKkk-8-rgb_front;03jABW2MKkk_12;03jABW2MKkk_12-8-rgb_front;96.2;96.83;Fingernails.;8;1
2917;03jABW2MKkk;03jABW2MKkk-8-rgb_front;03jABW2MKkk_13;03jABW2MKkk_13-8-rgb_front;106.18;112.52;And, you have the front view of clasped hands.;8;9
2918;03jABW2MKkk;03jABW2MKkk-8-rgb_front;03jABW2MKkk_14;03jABW2MKkk_14-8-rgb_front;113.81;115.95;And that is one way to draw clasped hands.;8;9
2919;03jABW2MKkk;03jABW2MKkk-8-rgb_front;03jABW2MKkk_15;03jABW2MKkk_15-8-rgb_front;115.95;118.36;Remember to look for photo sources as your best bet.;8;10
2920;03jABW2MKkk;03jABW2MKkk-8-rgb_front;03jABW2MKkk_2;03jABW2MKkk_2-8-rgb_front;19.46;32.35;We have your basic wedge of a hand, give the impression of that, but, and I've done them too far apart, so, we want them clasped tight so let's do this.;8;31
2921;03jABW2MKkk;03jABW2MKkk-8-rgb_front;03jABW2MKkk_3;03jABW2MKkk_3-8-rgb_front;33.67;38.87;Start with your thumbs and draw the thumb that's going to go over the top first.;8;16
2922;03jABW2MKkk;03jABW2MKkk-8-rgb_front;03jABW2MKkk_4;03jABW2MKkk_4-8-rgb_front;39.75;47.59;And one underneath second, and from here you would think you would just be drawing something like this.;8;18
2923;03jABW2MKkk;03jABW2MKkk-8-rgb_front;03jABW2MKkk_5;03jABW2MKkk_5-8-rgb_front;47.96;56.69;But it doesn't work that way because they overlap, so draw your top finger again, and it's going to be the same hand, if you clasp your own fingers you'll notice this.;8;32
2924;03jABW2MKkk;03jABW2MKkk-8-rgb_front;03jABW2MKkk_6;03jABW2MKkk_6-8-rgb_front;56.69;59.24;It's going to be the same hand that has the thumb on top.;8;13
2925;03jABW2MKkk;03jABW2MKkk-8-rgb_front;03jABW2MKkk_7;03jABW2MKkk_7-8-rgb_front;60.49;61.75;It's your top finger in there.;8;6
2926;03jABW2MKkk;03jABW2MKkk-8-rgb_front;03jABW2MKkk_8;03jABW2MKkk_8-8-rgb_front;61.75;70.35;Now you have a smaller, because it's half covered by the other hand, ring finger, or index finger from that hand.;8;21
2927;03jABW2MKkk;03jABW2MKkk-8-rgb_front;03jABW2MKkk_9;03jABW2MKkk_9-8-rgb_front;70.35;73.39;And the same thing is happening here, it's half covered until it comes out here.;8;15
2928;03lzv6OzJhE;03lzv6OzJhE-8-rgb_front;03lzv6OzJhE_1;03lzv6OzJhE_1-8-rgb_front;7.18;11.36;Yep we are going to deep fry this and we are going to have a breading on it that is just going to taste great.;8;25
2929;03lzv6OzJhE;03lzv6OzJhE-8-rgb_front;03lzv6OzJhE_10;03lzv6OzJhE_10-8-rgb_front;83.01;92.72;Here we go alright so we would finish this up, up here.;8;12
2930;03lzv6OzJhE;03lzv6OzJhE-8-rgb_front;03lzv6OzJhE_11;03lzv6OzJhE_11-8-rgb_front;94.74;103.98;I will these into the deep fryer and see how long it take to get them fry.;8;17
2931;03lzv6OzJhE;03lzv6OzJhE-8-rgb_front;03lzv6OzJhE_12;03lzv6OzJhE_12-8-rgb_front;105.42;106.47;Clean off my fingers.;8;4
2932;03lzv6OzJhE;03lzv6OzJhE-8-rgb_front;03lzv6OzJhE_13;03lzv6OzJhE_13-8-rgb_front;107.87;112.82;Okay we are goign to put these into the basket here.;8;11
2933;03lzv6OzJhE;03lzv6OzJhE-8-rgb_front;03lzv6OzJhE_14;03lzv6OzJhE_14-8-rgb_front;119.99;124.4;Next segment we are going to do we are going to do something very interesting we are going to do some oysters.;8;22
2934;03lzv6OzJhE;03lzv6OzJhE-8-rgb_front;03lzv6OzJhE_15;03lzv6OzJhE_15-8-rgb_front;124.77;132.69;So when we come with this we see how many minutes it took to cook it and when it is golden brown it is done and then we would start on the oysters for you.;8;35
2935;03lzv6OzJhE;03lzv6OzJhE-8-rgb_front;03lzv6OzJhE_16;03lzv6OzJhE_16-8-rgb_front;133.32;147.53;Okay I think these are ready now they have been in here for 4 1/2 minutes we had the temperature up about 375 and it depends on your taste if you like them a little bit darker then you could leave them a little longer but really watch them.;8;49
2936;03lzv6OzJhE;03lzv6OzJhE-8-rgb_front;03lzv6OzJhE_17;03lzv6OzJhE_17-8-rgb_front;148.12;152.39;Cause once they start to get really brown they go fast.;8;11
2937;03lzv6OzJhE;03lzv6OzJhE-8-rgb_front;03lzv6OzJhE_18;03lzv6OzJhE_18-8-rgb_front;152.94;159.33;Alright here you go simple, easy, delicious, deep fried calamari.;8;10
2938;03lzv6OzJhE;03lzv6OzJhE-8-rgb_front;03lzv6OzJhE_19;03lzv6OzJhE_19-8-rgb_front;159.4;162.6;Find your you special sauce and go dipping go eat it.;8;11
2939;03lzv6OzJhE;03lzv6OzJhE-8-rgb_front;03lzv6OzJhE_20;03lzv6OzJhE_20-8-rgb_front;162.6;167.3;The next thing you see from us the next segment would be oysters deep fried in breading.;8;17
2940;03lzv6OzJhE;03lzv6OzJhE-8-rgb_front;03lzv6OzJhE_2_3;03lzv6OzJhE_2_3-8-rgb_front;11.45;20.34;I will show you how to do it. First off this is calamari that has been cut we had it cut first and we are going to go ahead and use these.;8;32

3228;06k75HRlfqc;06k75HRlfqc-8-rgb_front;06k75HRlfqc_1;06k75HRlfqc_1-8-rgb_front;5.87;12.56;So a few years ago Bikram yoga was developed and franchised by Bikram Chadroy.;8;14
3229;06k75HRlfqc;06k75HRlfqc-8-rgb_front;06k75HRlfqc_10;06k75HRlfqc_10-8-rgb_front;69.48;75.18;So hot yoga, hot room, hot practice, hope you enjoy it.;8;11
3230;06k75HRlfqc;06k75HRlfqc-8-rgb_front;06k75HRlfqc_2;06k75HRlfqc_2-8-rgb_front;12.7;20.72;From that branched out a lot of styles of hot yoga that didn't really have anything to do with the franchise of Bikram yoga.;8;24
3231;06k75HRlfqc;06k75HRlfqc-8-rgb_front;06k75HRlfqc_3;06k75HRlfqc_3-8-rgb_front;21.15;27.83;But in essence hot yoga is a yoga style that is practiced within a room that is deliberately heated.;8;19
3232;06k75HRlfqc;06k75HRlfqc-8-rgb_front;06k75HRlfqc_4;06k75HRlfqc_4-8-rgb_front;28.08;31.23;Sometimes up to temperatures of a hundred and ten degrees.;8;10
3233;06k75HRlfqc;06k75HRlfqc-8-rgb_front;06k75HRlfqc_5;06k75HRlfqc_5-8-rgb_front;31.68;38.46;And the purpose of heating the room in a hot yoga class is to create greater detoxification benefits.;8;18
3234;06k75HRlfqc;06k75HRlfqc-8-rgb_front;06k75HRlfqc_6;06k75HRlfqc_6-8-rgb_front;38.74;47.1;So not only are you internally heating through your breath and through the movement of postures from one posture to the next, but the room is externally heated.;8;28
3235;06k75HRlfqc;06k75HRlfqc-8-rgb_front;06k75HRlfqc_7;06k75HRlfqc_7-8-rgb_front;47.31;52.81;And there should be a little bit of humanity within that, that sphere of the room.;8;16
3236;06k75HRlfqc;06k75HRlfqc-8-rgb_front;06k75HRlfqc_8;06k75HRlfqc_8-8-rgb_front;53.19;62.51;You may find various sequences in a hot yoga class where Bikram yoga is one particular sequence and one particular class of twenty six postures.;8;25

3602;09GN-XezUJg;09GN-XezUJg-8-rgb_front;09GN-XezUJg_11;09GN-XezUJg_11-8-rgb_front;64.92;70.07;That is the benefit to tutoring as a job.;8;9

3609;09GN-XezUJg;09GN-XezUJg-8-rgb_front;09GN-XezUJg_8;09GN-XezUJg_8-8-rgb_front;42.44;48.47;It's also a pretty fun job if you like explaining things and it makes you feel smart.;8;17

3637;09PTYSJ3dmA;09PTYSJ3dmA-8-rgb_front;09PTYSJ3dmA_3;09PTYSJ3dmA_3-8-rgb_front;34.72;40.68;Some people think that they look a little nerdy but, you know, you have new style of helmets with, you know, a brand that looks pretty cool.;8;27

3640;09PTYSJ3dmA;09PTYSJ3dmA-8-rgb_front;09PTYSJ3dmA_6;09PTYSJ3dmA_6-8-rgb_front;62.36;66.96;And these whole things right here, the ribs, don't feel too good when they're broken.;8;15

3910;0C_NjyLtHwc;0C_NjyLtHwc-8-rgb_front;0C_NjyLtHwc_7;0C_NjyLtHwc_7-8-rgb_front;29.52;34.51;Okay so what we want to do is find the holes where they were before.;8;15

3938;0CecLZXqzZ4;0CecLZXqzZ4-8-rgb_front;0CecLZXqzZ4_6;0CecLZXqzZ4_6-8-rgb_front;46.5;57.19;You know, whatever it may take, I might fake it and go back to the outside, step over it again, well basically you're just sitting there, you're keeping control, you're watching the ball, you know where the ball goes itself.;8;40

5138;0sal9F4RXeY;0sal9F4RXeY-8-rgb_front;0sal9F4RXeY_30;0sal9F4RXeY_30-8-rgb_front;227.31;228.7;And there's our mending.;8;4
5139;0sal9F4RXeY;0sal9F4RXeY-8-rgb_front;0sal9F4RXeY_31;0sal9F4RXeY_31-8-rgb_front;228.73;233.28;I mean sometimes it shows more than other times.;8;9
5140;0sal9F4RXeY;0sal9F4RXeY-8-rgb_front;0sal9F4RXeY_32;0sal9F4RXeY_32-8-rgb_front;233.59;236.5;You can also set it by kind of pressing it.;8;10
5141;0sal9F4RXeY;0sal9F4RXeY-8-rgb_front;0sal9F4RXeY_33;0sal9F4RXeY_33-8-rgb_front;236.63;241.99;Stretching a little bit in different directions to make it disappear more into the fabric.;8;15
5142;0sal9F4RXeY;0sal9F4RXeY-8-rgb_front;0sal9F4RXeY_34;0sal9F4RXeY_34-8-rgb_front;242.47;248.16;And sometimes just ironing it will help but.;8;8
5143;0sal9F4RXeY;0sal9F4RXeY-8-rgb_front;0sal9F4RXeY_35;0sal9F4RXeY_35-8-rgb_front;248.84;255.84;Ironing will help to set the part that you kind of pulled taut in there and it'll set it down flatter.;8;21
5144;0sal9F4RXeY;0sal9F4RXeY-8-rgb_front;0sal9F4RXeY_36;0sal9F4RXeY_36-8-rgb_front;256.51;259.69;So that's just an easy stitching of a hole.;8;9
5145;0sal9F4RXeY;0sal9F4RXeY-8-rgb_front;0sal9F4RXeY_4;0sal9F4RXeY_4-8-rgb_front;37.89;40.81;It can look totally off, darker or lighter.;8;8
5146;0sal9F4RXeY;0sal9F4RXeY-8-rgb_front;0sal9F4RXeY_5;0sal9F4RXeY_5-8-rgb_front;40.81;48.09;So when you take a piece of thread off and hold it against the fabric and it kind of disappears then you know you've got the right color.;8;28
5147;0sal9F4RXeY;0sal9F4RXeY-8-rgb_front;0sal9F4RXeY_6;0sal9F4RXeY_6-8-rgb_front;49.62;54.46;So you just take a length of thread not too long because the longer it is the more it tends to knot.;8;22
5148;0sal9F4RXeY;0sal9F4RXeY-8-rgb_front;0sal9F4RXeY_7;0sal9F4RXeY_7-8-rgb_front;55.19;60.22;And I personally do not use knots because they can wear off, pull out.;8;14
5149;0sal9F4RXeY;0sal9F4RXeY-8-rgb_front;0sal9F4RXeY_8;0sal9F4RXeY_8-8-rgb_front;61.49;66.17;So I use three little loops to start my sewing.;8;10
5150;0sal9F4RXeY;0sal9F4RXeY-8-rgb_front;0sal9F4RXeY_9;0sal9F4RXeY_9-8-rgb_front;66.52;69.65;And you can start by doing just three tiny little places.;8;11

5193;0syI-83QSVM;0syI-83QSVM-8-rgb_front;0syI-83QSVM_11;0syI-83QSVM_11-8-rgb_front;71.04;91.15;Other birds like the eastern king bird typically fly on the tips of their wings and have a very peculiar flickering flight, swallows like these purple martins off to my left here, skim and swoop so these would all be behavioral features that would be very useful in helping you identify an unfamiliar bird.;8;54
5194;0syI-83QSVM;0syI-83QSVM-8-rgb_front;0syI-83QSVM_12;0syI-83QSVM_12-8-rgb_front;92.21;97.53;In general, when we first see a bird, we want to try and put it into some sort of a category.;8;21
5195;0syI-83QSVM;0syI-83QSVM-8-rgb_front;0syI-83QSVM_13;0syI-83QSVM_13-8-rgb_front;98.62;111.04;This of course can be based on the way birds are classified and in fact, in most of the popular field guides today, birds are actually grouped and organized based on their scientific classification.;8;34
5196;0syI-83QSVM;0syI-83QSVM-8-rgb_front;0syI-83QSVM_14;0syI-83QSVM_14-8-rgb_front;112.03;122.95;If we start with the water birds, which typically occur first in the taxonomic higher arky that's typical of most field guides, we are obviously looking at fairly large birds.;8;30
5197;0syI-83QSVM;0syI-83QSVM-8-rgb_front;0syI-83QSVM_15;0syI-83QSVM_15-8-rgb_front;123.26;136.03;Many of which in deed are associated with wetlands, as appose to many of the forest and woodland birds that would be much smaller and would obviously be more settle in terms of some of their identification characteristics.;8;38
5198;0syI-83QSVM;0syI-83QSVM-8-rgb_front;0syI-83QSVM_16;0syI-83QSVM_16-8-rgb_front;136.51;147.75;So as we move forward through some of these different groups of birds, we would be using different characteristics and different features as we begin to put them into categories that can be useful for field identification.;8;37
5199;0syI-83QSVM;0syI-83QSVM-8-rgb_front;0syI-83QSVM_2;0syI-83QSVM_2-8-rgb_front;3.47;9.35;My name is Wayne Peterson and I'm the director of the Important Bird Areas Program for the Massachusetts Audubon Society.;8;20

5201;0syI-83QSVM;0syI-83QSVM-8-rgb_front;0syI-83QSVM_4;0syI-83QSVM_4-8-rgb_front;25.74;34.48;One of the things that's very important as we begin to think about identifying birds in the field is to sort of understand what we need to look for.;8;29
5202;0syI-83QSVM;0syI-83QSVM-8-rgb_front;0syI-83QSVM_5;0syI-83QSVM_5-8-rgb_front;34.99;42.13;We mentioned briefly the topographical features of the bird, but there are other things in addition to the physical appearance of the bird.;8;23
5203;0syI-83QSVM;0syI-83QSVM-8-rgb_front;0syI-83QSVM_6;0syI-83QSVM_6-8-rgb_front;42.9;43.81;For example, habit.;8;3

5205;0syI-83QSVM;0syI-83QSVM-8-rgb_front;0syI-83QSVM_8;0syI-83QSVM_8-8-rgb_front;59.77;61.99;At the same time, we can use behavior.;8;8
5206;0syI-83QSVM;0syI-83QSVM-8-rgb_front;0syI-83QSVM_9;0syI-83QSVM_9-8-rgb_front;62.71;64.65;For example, the way a bird flies.;8;7
5207;0t19eYsWPyg;0t19eYsWPyg-8-rgb_front;0t19eYsWPyg_0;0t19eYsWPyg_0-8-rgb_front;1.77;8.93;Now that you have the focal flowers in, the next thing we need to do is to add some accent flowers along with this.;8;24
5208;0t19eYsWPyg;0t19eYsWPyg-8-rgb_front;0t19eYsWPyg_1;0t19eYsWPyg_1-8-rgb_front;9.32;18.03;One of the things that's the best to do and to help keep the cost down on doing flower arrangements in silk is you buy a bush.;8;27
5209;0t19eYsWPyg;0t19eYsWPyg-8-rgb_front;0t19eYsWPyg_10;0t19eYsWPyg_10-8-rgb_front;103.07;108.92;But you need to put some color in there as well so it looks good from a distance.;8;18
5210;0t19eYsWPyg;0t19eYsWPyg-8-rgb_front;0t19eYsWPyg_11;0t19eYsWPyg_11-8-rgb_front;109.89;114.76;Okay and the other thing is is this is a typical different flower.;8;13
5211;0t19eYsWPyg;0t19eYsWPyg-8-rgb_front;0t19eYsWPyg_12;0t19eYsWPyg_12-8-rgb_front;114.76;119.54;We're going to start adding texture to it and that will be another part of the filler flowers that we add.;8;21
5212;0t19eYsWPyg;0t19eYsWPyg-8-rgb_front;0t19eYsWPyg_13;0t19eYsWPyg_13-8-rgb_front;119.98;124.76;So right now what we're doing is putting in filler to support the main rose flowers.;8;16
5213;0t19eYsWPyg;0t19eYsWPyg-8-rgb_front;0t19eYsWPyg_14;0t19eYsWPyg_14-8-rgb_front;125.59;128.0;And that's the end of this step.;8;7
5214;0t19eYsWPyg;0t19eYsWPyg-8-rgb_front;0t19eYsWPyg_2;0t19eYsWPyg_2-8-rgb_front;18.09;23.69;Which is consistent of flowers together coming down to one stem and then you can cut them apart.;8;18
5215;0t19eYsWPyg;0t19eYsWPyg-8-rgb_front;0t19eYsWPyg_3;0t19eYsWPyg_3-8-rgb_front;24.22;31.24;So what you try to do is you cut your flowers to a reasonable length that you think will work in the bridal bouquet.;8;24
5216;0t19eYsWPyg;0t19eYsWPyg-8-rgb_front;0t19eYsWPyg_4;0t19eYsWPyg_4-8-rgb_front;32.1;38.65;And you can start placing them in supporting the look of your focal flowers.;8;14
5217;0t19eYsWPyg;0t19eYsWPyg-8-rgb_front;0t19eYsWPyg_5;0t19eYsWPyg_5-8-rgb_front;38.65;56.17;And the other positive thing about doing silk flowers is that you can just bend and arrange them any which way you like.;8;23
5218;0t19eYsWPyg;0t19eYsWPyg-8-rgb_front;0t19eYsWPyg_6;0t19eYsWPyg_6-8-rgb_front;56.22;82.5;Fresh flowers it's basically God's made them and you've just got to work with what He's given you to do it.;8;21

5220;0t19eYsWPyg;0t19eYsWPyg-8-rgb_front;0t19eYsWPyg_8;0t19eYsWPyg_8-8-rgb_front;94.25;98.14;So we need to make sure that the side is covered as well.;8;13
5221;0t19eYsWPyg;0t19eYsWPyg-8-rgb_front;0t19eYsWPyg_9;0t19eYsWPyg_9-8-rgb_front;98.24;102.37;But this is usually what you use with the smaller flowers and your greeneries.;8;14
5245;0t94zPbIPTw;0t94zPbIPTw-8-rgb_front;0t94zPbIPTw_1;0t94zPbIPTw_1-8-rgb_front;6.46;10.65;So, with the roasting of the garlic what I like to do is just cook it for like ten minutes.;8;20
5246;0t94zPbIPTw;0t94zPbIPTw-8-rgb_front;0t94zPbIPTw_10;0t94zPbIPTw_10-8-rgb_front;72.01;76.71;You got your roasted garlic and believe me this roasted garlic is gonna be wonderful, you're gonna love it.;8;19

5248;0t94zPbIPTw;0t94zPbIPTw-8-rgb_front;0t94zPbIPTw_2;0t94zPbIPTw_2-8-rgb_front;10.65;19.57;I take it out and what I do then is I just get some tin foil and I actually wrap them up like a baked potato then.;8;27

5263;0tKYBKBXuv0;0tKYBKBXuv0-8-rgb_front;0tKYBKBXuv0_8;0tKYBKBXuv0_8-8-rgb_front;48.52;58.96;There is a utility that was developed to setup mapping data on polygonal structures to help in creating texture maps or image maps and it's called UVMapper.;8;27

5277;0t_nltnZdsg;0t_nltnZdsg-8-rgb_front;0t_nltnZdsg_2;0t_nltnZdsg_2-8-rgb_front;13.04;30.63;Studies have shown that although there are no real known causes of this particular syndrome some research is saying a certain deficiency in vitamins and minerals can actually produce add to higher chance of getting this syndrome.;8;37
5278;0t_nltnZdsg;0t_nltnZdsg-8-rgb_front;0t_nltnZdsg_3;0t_nltnZdsg_3-8-rgb_front;30.91;46.37;So folic acid and folic acid and iron deficiency can put you at added risk of getting restless leg syndrome, so in your diet, even if you donât get restless leg syndrome.;8;32
5279;0t_nltnZdsg;0t_nltnZdsg-8-rgb_front;0t_nltnZdsg_4;0t_nltnZdsg_4-8-rgb_front;46.4;54.2;Itâs good to make sure that you also get your daily recommended supplements or intake of vitamins and minerals.;8;19
5280;0t_nltnZdsg;0t_nltnZdsg-8-rgb_front;0t_nltnZdsg_5;0t_nltnZdsg_5-8-rgb_front;54.57;63.52;So in the local drug store or super markets you can get ready, available as Iâve shown here a lot of these products.;8;23
5281;0t_nltnZdsg;0t_nltnZdsg-8-rgb_front;0t_nltnZdsg_6;0t_nltnZdsg_6-8-rgb_front;65.44;97.86;Its readily available here we have a bottle of folic acid and you should also make sure that you get your recommended daily dose and that will also help to alleviate symptoms of restless leg syndrome, multi vitamins because a lot of these products have iron included into them but besides taking these supplements its recommended that you take it in from natural foods.;8;64
5282;0t_nltnZdsg;0t_nltnZdsg-8-rgb_front;0t_nltnZdsg_7;0t_nltnZdsg_7-8-rgb_front;98.1;110.32;So make sure that you eat a lot of foods that contain iron like liver, you know the greens, the green vegetables, contain iron and folic as well.;8;28
5283;0t_nltnZdsg;0t_nltnZdsg-8-rgb_front;0t_nltnZdsg_8;0t_nltnZdsg_8-8-rgb_front;110.67;121.47;So besides taking in supplements and taking it from the food and the way that you cook your food as well maintain that the benefits are in tact before you eat it.;8;32
5284;0t_nltnZdsg;0t_nltnZdsg-8-rgb_front;0t_nltnZdsg_9;0t_nltnZdsg_9-8-rgb_front;121.5;133.49;So restless leg syndrome can be prevented or reduced instances by making sure you have the daily intake of the recommended daily vitamins and minerals.;8;25
5285;0ta2ddEzBA0;0ta2ddEzBA0-8-rgb_front;0ta2ddEzBA0_0;0ta2ddEzBA0_0-8-rgb_front;0.67;5.68;O.k., so the next thing that we're going to do is called an in and out and I'm going to show the ladies their footwork.;8;25
5286;0ta2ddEzBA0;0ta2ddEzBA0-8-rgb_front;0ta2ddEzBA0_1;0ta2ddEzBA0_1-8-rgb_front;5.71;9.9;Basically this is just a variation of the inside turn footwork that you learned before.;8;15
5287;0ta2ddEzBA0;0ta2ddEzBA0-8-rgb_front;0ta2ddEzBA0_10;0ta2ddEzBA0_10-8-rgb_front;54.51;63.78;It goes, back, rock, change direction, and turn, six, seven, basic, one, two, three, five, six, seven.;8;17
5288;0ta2ddEzBA0;0ta2ddEzBA0-8-rgb_front;0ta2ddEzBA0_2;0ta2ddEzBA0_2-8-rgb_front;10.15;12.15;So all we're going to do is change directions.;8;9
5289;0ta2ddEzBA0;0ta2ddEzBA0-8-rgb_front;0ta2ddEzBA0_3;0ta2ddEzBA0_3-8-rgb_front;12.42;28.07;So instead of going, one, two, three and doing our inside turn this way, now we're going to go, one, two, change directions, and do the inside turn back the way we came, five, six seven, one two, three.;8;39
5290;0ta2ddEzBA0;0ta2ddEzBA0-8-rgb_front;0ta2ddEzBA0_4;0ta2ddEzBA0_4-8-rgb_front;28.67;37.32;So we do our back, rock on one, two, instead of coming together on three, we're going to step out to the side putting all our weight on the right foot, sticking that hip out a little bit.;8;38
5291;0ta2ddEzBA0;0ta2ddEzBA0-8-rgb_front;0ta2ddEzBA0_5;0ta2ddEzBA0_5-8-rgb_front;37.32;38.78;Kind of like you're standing at the bus stop.;8;9
5292;0ta2ddEzBA0;0ta2ddEzBA0-8-rgb_front;0ta2ddEzBA0_6;0ta2ddEzBA0_6-8-rgb_front;38.9;39.21;Alright?;8;1
5293;0ta2ddEzBA0;0ta2ddEzBA0-8-rgb_front;0ta2ddEzBA0_7;0ta2ddEzBA0_7-8-rgb_front;39.24;44.52;So this is three, now we're going to go back this way, exactly the same inside turn footwork.;8;18
5294;0ta2ddEzBA0;0ta2ddEzBA0-8-rgb_front;0ta2ddEzBA0_8;0ta2ddEzBA0_8-8-rgb_front;44.61;52.59;So we're going to start with our left foot, turn left, right, left, and basic, back, rock, together, so you end up facing the same way that you started.;8;29
5295;0ta2ddEzBA0;0ta2ddEzBA0-8-rgb_front;0ta2ddEzBA0_9;0ta2ddEzBA0_9-8-rgb_front;53.02;54.51;One more time all together.;8;5
5296;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_0;0tbZoN0v4OE_0-8-rgb_front;0.51;4.81;Okay folks in this clip I'm going to teach you how to draw a Capuchin monkey.;8;16
5297;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_1;0tbZoN0v4OE_1-8-rgb_front;4.81;17.1;I'm going to start right here and we're going to do what first of all I would describe as just the basic outer proportions and dimensions of the monkey itself.;8;30
5298;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_10;0tbZoN0v4OE_10-8-rgb_front;73.25;75.66;And we'll get to those in a second along with the feet.;8;12
5299;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_11;0tbZoN0v4OE_11-8-rgb_front;75.69;79.83;Now we're going to go back to the head right here, because that's going to be one of the more important parts.;8;22
5300;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_12;0tbZoN0v4OE_12-8-rgb_front;79.83;83.26;Now the first thing that you're going to want to do is the eyes, I think.;8;16
5301;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_13;0tbZoN0v4OE_13-8-rgb_front;83.77;96.73;And if you're drawing a cartoon, obviously you can do this a wide variety of ways, but I'll tell you one characteristic that this monkey has, his eyes are very dark.;8;31
5302;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_14;0tbZoN0v4OE_14-8-rgb_front;96.76;98.81;Most monkeys have very dark eyes, if you've noticed.;8;9
5303;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_15;0tbZoN0v4OE_15-8-rgb_front;99.15;101.17;You don't see a lot of white in any of their eyes.;8;12
5304;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_16;0tbZoN0v4OE_16-8-rgb_front;101.17;109.43;So if I were you I'd fill up most of his eye with black, just to kind of give it the right effect.;8;23
5305;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_17;0tbZoN0v4OE_17-8-rgb_front;109.43;114.88;Then of course add a little personality, he goes kind of come up in the angle of his eyebrows a little bit.;8;22
5306;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_2;0tbZoN0v4OE_2-8-rgb_front;17.65;23.31;Start by drawing sort of an odd oval shape, which will be the foundation for your head.;8;17
5307;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_26;0tbZoN0v4OE_26-8-rgb_front;159.48;161.21;The furry part being over here.;8;6
5308;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_27;0tbZoN0v4OE_27-8-rgb_front;165.15;165.86;Just like that.;8;3
5309;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_28;0tbZoN0v4OE_28-8-rgb_front;166.03;173.73;Now we've got his back kind of going already, so kind of come down here and draw the fur along side his back, coming up here and give him a tail.;8;31
5310;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_29;0tbZoN0v4OE_29-8-rgb_front;173.76;177.9;Another distinct characteristic I would say.;8;6
5311;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_3;0tbZoN0v4OE_3-8-rgb_front;24.18;32.26;Then come in and we're going to draw his back kind of coming on down like that, that will be the top back part of his body.;8;27
5312;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_30;0tbZoN0v4OE_30-8-rgb_front;178.55;180.44;You don't have to make that as hairy if you don't want to.;8;13
5313;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_31;0tbZoN0v4OE_31-8-rgb_front;180.75;186.55;Now to add detail tot he feet, just ,kind of come in here along the bottom, hands same way.;8;19
5314;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_32;0tbZoN0v4OE_32-8-rgb_front;187.14;193.92;These Capuchin monkeys don't really have large hands, they have little bit smaller limbs.;8;14
5315;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_33;0tbZoN0v4OE_33-8-rgb_front;193.92;202.28;So you don't have to add quite the length that you would add to say a gorilla or any other monkey really.;8;22
5316;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_34;0tbZoN0v4OE_34-8-rgb_front;202.28;208.2;Because a lot of them, I mean they do use their hands for climbing, but Capuchin monkeys a little bit smaller hands.;8;22
5317;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_35;0tbZoN0v4OE_35-8-rgb_front;208.2;210.18;They're kind of like spider monkeys.;8;6
5318;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_36;0tbZoN0v4OE_36-8-rgb_front;211.1;212.48;And that's pretty much it.;8;5
5319;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_37;0tbZoN0v4OE_37-8-rgb_front;213.17;216.48;If you got that down you've got yourself a nice little Capuchin monkey.;8;13
5320;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_4;0tbZoN0v4OE_4-8-rgb_front;33.17;39.77;And as you're doing this, especially with free features, it's okay if you don't draw a perfectly smooth, straight lines like I did right here.;8;25
5321;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_5;0tbZoN0v4OE_5-8-rgb_front;39.77;47.53;Simply because you know a lot of times you're going to be feeling out the design, and there's nothing wrong with kind of experimenting while you feel it out.;8;29
5322;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_6;0tbZoN0v4OE_6-8-rgb_front;47.95;55.23;This line right here is going to be his leg, and it's going to kind of come behind what will be his arm.;8;23
5323;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_7;0tbZoN0v4OE_7-8-rgb_front;55.43;57.41;So we're going to kind of draw it in like that.;8;11
5324;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_8;0tbZoN0v4OE_8-8-rgb_front;57.41;63.5;And monkey's often times will be found sitting in more squatted positions, so it's okay to kind of draw them that way.;8;22
5325;0tbZoN0v4OE;0tbZoN0v4OE-8-rgb_front;0tbZoN0v4OE_9;0tbZoN0v4OE_9-8-rgb_front;65.32;71.42;Make his arm kind of come out like that, both of them will kind of be resting right out in front of him.;8;23
5376;0tyxKl8Uzy4;0tyxKl8Uzy4-8-rgb_front;0tyxKl8Uzy4_0;0tyxKl8Uzy4_0-8-rgb_front;0.32;6.35;Remember when I told you it was so hard to collect Barbie dolls and the sense of knowing exactly all the different Barbie's that are out there.;8;27
5377;0tyxKl8Uzy4;0tyxKl8Uzy4-8-rgb_front;0tyxKl8Uzy4_1;0tyxKl8Uzy4_1-8-rgb_front;6.42;14.44;One of the things that is difficult to do is remember which Barbie dolls you have when shopping so the best way to do that is to create your own list.;8;31
5378;0tyxKl8Uzy4;0tyxKl8Uzy4-8-rgb_front;0tyxKl8Uzy4_10;0tyxKl8Uzy4_10-8-rgb_front;93.76;104.54;You can do around the Barbie's to actually see how many you bought in the you know last month or how much your spending on your Barbie doll collection, or you know what years that your majority Barbie doll collection is.;8;41
5379;0tyxKl8Uzy4;0tyxKl8Uzy4-8-rgb_front;0tyxKl8Uzy4_11;0tyxKl8Uzy4_11-8-rgb_front;104.96;114.47;You can actually keep track of all that information right in the computer and in addition to that there's another place that you can store information besides tracking it yourself on excel spreadsheet.;8;33
5380;0tyxKl8Uzy4;0tyxKl8Uzy4-8-rgb_front;0tyxKl8Uzy4_12;0tyxKl8Uzy4_12-8-rgb_front;114.72;126.55;If you go out to barbiecollector.com it's actually a website by Mattel that allows you to track and keep track of all your Barbie dolls online with Mattel to actually let you store your collection.;8;35
5381;0tyxKl8Uzy4;0tyxKl8Uzy4-8-rgb_front;0tyxKl8Uzy4_2;0tyxKl8Uzy4_2-8-rgb_front;14.75;22.82;I have my own tracking list that I actually have on Microsoft excel on my computer and I keep up with the Barbie doll and the value of what the Barbie doll is worth.;8;34
5382;0tyxKl8Uzy4;0tyxKl8Uzy4-8-rgb_front;0tyxKl8Uzy4_3;0tyxKl8Uzy4_3-8-rgb_front;23.27;35.22;For example, you can look at name of my doll where that doll is so for example my first one Kelly Club Santa Clause and then it will say the year that it was made which I found on the bottom of my box.;8;44
5383;0tyxKl8Uzy4;0tyxKl8Uzy4-8-rgb_front;0tyxKl8Uzy4_4;0tyxKl8Uzy4_4-8-rgb_front;35.6;45.41;The third column consist of the nationality so for instance you get buy certain Barbie dolls like Caroling Fun actually come in African American doll the same as a blonde doll.;8;31
5384;0tyxKl8Uzy4;0tyxKl8Uzy4-8-rgb_front;0tyxKl8Uzy4_5;0tyxKl8Uzy4_5-8-rgb_front;45.67;55.51;So you need to know specifically which one you have so I would mark as 2003 Caucasian blonde cause some of them might be brunette, as well as red heads.;8;30
5385;0tyxKl8Uzy4;0tyxKl8Uzy4-8-rgb_front;0tyxKl8Uzy4_6;0tyxKl8Uzy4_6-8-rgb_front;55.51;67.3;So you have to keep track of that and then if it's a series I put that on there it it's a pink label, or some set of series at if 5 dolls came in that you want to track and keep that there as well.;8;46
5386;0tyxKl8Uzy4;0tyxKl8Uzy4-8-rgb_front;0tyxKl8Uzy4_7;0tyxKl8Uzy4_7-8-rgb_front;67.84;76.97;And then the doll type because sometimes I say more than just Barbie I save here friends as well like Ken, Kelly, and Christy and all those people that come as her friends.;8;33
5387;0tyxKl8Uzy4;0tyxKl8Uzy4-8-rgb_front;0tyxKl8Uzy4_8;0tyxKl8Uzy4_8-8-rgb_front;77.32;80.96;So you need to keep track of all that and then the dollar value what that Barbie doll is worth.;8;20
5388;0tyxKl8Uzy4;0tyxKl8Uzy4-8-rgb_front;0tyxKl8Uzy4_9;0tyxKl8Uzy4_9-8-rgb_front;82.45;93.48;So this is an example like I said of the list of the tracking list that you can keep track of you can actually even do a database on your computer if you so desire if you know access database or some of the other types of applications that are out there.;8;52
5389;0u83ZskRPt0;0u83ZskRPt0-8-rgb_front;0u83ZskRPt0_0;0u83ZskRPt0_0-8-rgb_front;0.37;6.97;So here you have the possibility to look inside this kind of chipper shredder.;8;14
5390;0u83ZskRPt0;0u83ZskRPt0-8-rgb_front;0u83ZskRPt0_1;0u83ZskRPt0_1-8-rgb_front;6.97;11.57;And you see here there's still some of the mulch is sticking here.;8;13
5391;0u83ZskRPt0;0u83ZskRPt0-8-rgb_front;0u83ZskRPt0_10;0u83ZskRPt0_10-8-rgb_front;85.99;89.9;So that will be the movement but much faster when the thing is running.;8;14
5392;0u83ZskRPt0;0u83ZskRPt0-8-rgb_front;0u83ZskRPt0_11;0u83ZskRPt0_11-8-rgb_front;90.65;106.72;And normally after five to ten hours, it depends on how hot your wood is you just open the screws, you remove this knife here that's a two bladed knife so you can one times, just turn it around and use it on the other side.;8;46
5393;0u83ZskRPt0;0u83ZskRPt0-8-rgb_front;0u83ZskRPt0_12;0u83ZskRPt0_12-8-rgb_front;107.13;115.1;But when both sides are not sharp any more I use a little grinder, and grind the edges again until they are sharp.;8;23
5394;0u83ZskRPt0;0u83ZskRPt0-8-rgb_front;0u83ZskRPt0_2;0u83ZskRPt0_2-8-rgb_front;11.9;19.8;And you look here it has four knives, and you see the knives here they are on this part they are very sharp.;8;23
5395;0u83ZskRPt0;0u83ZskRPt0-8-rgb_front;0u83ZskRPt0_3;0u83ZskRPt0_3-8-rgb_front;20.73;30.53;And when the material comes in here and this thing is turning then it cuts chip by chip off the wood that's coming in here.;8;25
5396;0u83ZskRPt0;0u83ZskRPt0-8-rgb_front;0u83ZskRPt0_4;0u83ZskRPt0_4-8-rgb_front;30.89;39.78;So you should be very careful with your hands, if the hand the finger would come in here it would cut as fast as wood chip.;8;26
5397;0u83ZskRPt0;0u83ZskRPt0-8-rgb_front;0u83ZskRPt0_5;0u83ZskRPt0_5-8-rgb_front;40.27;47.05;So, and this thing here is solid metal and weighs over two hundred and fifty pounds.;8;16
5398;0u83ZskRPt0;0u83ZskRPt0-8-rgb_front;0u83ZskRPt0_6;0u83ZskRPt0_6-8-rgb_front;47.79;53.42;Because with a spin it's able to cut even logs up to eight inches.;8;14

5404;0uCaKKqoPSk;0uCaKKqoPSk-8-rgb_front;0uCaKKqoPSk_10;0uCaKKqoPSk_10-8-rgb_front;70.08;72.27;You are not going to be able to fix it no matter what you do.;8;15

5406;0uCaKKqoPSk;0uCaKKqoPSk-8-rgb_front;0uCaKKqoPSk_12;0uCaKKqoPSk_12-8-rgb_front;81.71;85.94;Work with a big area, maybe dig some of the bad soil out and put some good soil on top.;8;20
5407;0uCaKKqoPSk;0uCaKKqoPSk-8-rgb_front;0uCaKKqoPSk_13;0uCaKKqoPSk_13-8-rgb_front;86.64;100.44;You can buy compost, you can buy potting soil or you can buy compost or potting soil at pretty much any local garden center and it might be a little bit of money but you can buy a big truck load for not really in the scheme of things a whole lot of money.;8;54
5408;0uCaKKqoPSk;0uCaKKqoPSk-8-rgb_front;0uCaKKqoPSk_14;0uCaKKqoPSk_14-8-rgb_front;100.79;112.33;Think about how much money you put into your property and just for a few flower beds, just a couple truck loads of dirt, even one bag of dirt if you live in a little condo, you can have a gorgeous garden.;8;42
5409;0uCaKKqoPSk;0uCaKKqoPSk-8-rgb_front;0uCaKKqoPSk_15;0uCaKKqoPSk_15-8-rgb_front;112.86;127.53;So I really love raised beds and this is just composted soil that we had delivered and we put it in with a wooden bed and underneath is just rock hard compacted gravel and soil.;8;35
5410;0uCaKKqoPSk;0uCaKKqoPSk-8-rgb_front;0uCaKKqoPSk_16;0uCaKKqoPSk_16-8-rgb_front;127.53;132.55;There is really, underneath it is pretty, nothing is going to grow underneath it.;8;14
5411;0uCaKKqoPSk;0uCaKKqoPSk-8-rgb_front;0uCaKKqoPSk_17;0uCaKKqoPSk_17-8-rgb_front;133.03;137.43;But it is great because we are on a slope and it is good drainage, we are making a raised bed.;8;21
5412;0uCaKKqoPSk;0uCaKKqoPSk-8-rgb_front;0uCaKKqoPSk_18;0uCaKKqoPSk_18-8-rgb_front;137.43;141.14;I'm getting the heat of the sun coming in and everything is going to do really well.;8;17
5413;0uCaKKqoPSk;0uCaKKqoPSk-8-rgb_front;0uCaKKqoPSk_19;0uCaKKqoPSk_19-8-rgb_front;141.76;164.6;You can fix your poor soil by putting good soil on top of it so even the worst clay or sand if you put compost or potting soil on top of it it will work its way down and a lot of times it will gradually break everything up and as the plants grow and they have their healthy roots into the good soil, the roots will eventually get into the bad soil and enrich it as well.;8;78
5414;0uCaKKqoPSk;0uCaKKqoPSk-8-rgb_front;0uCaKKqoPSk_2;0uCaKKqoPSk_2-8-rgb_front;9.79;15.29;Everybody comes to me and I've had the same problem, all I have is clay, everything is rock hard.;8;19
5415;0uCaKKqoPSk;0uCaKKqoPSk-8-rgb_front;0uCaKKqoPSk_20;0uCaKKqoPSk_20-8-rgb_front;165.45;175.72;So pretty much there is no excuse that you can't plant there or if I have bad soil, I have good soil, I have bad soil in my yard, I work with both and either way I have a gorgeous garden.;8;41
5416;0uCaKKqoPSk;0uCaKKqoPSk-8-rgb_front;0uCaKKqoPSk_3;0uCaKKqoPSk_3-8-rgb_front;15.29;16.63;I can't get anything to grow.;8;6
5417;0uCaKKqoPSk;0uCaKKqoPSk-8-rgb_front;0uCaKKqoPSk_4;0uCaKKqoPSk_4-8-rgb_front;17.14;27.95;I live at the beach, all I have is sand, can I grow right in sand, what do I do, or I live up in the mountains with just rocks, I have nothing but rocks so how do I grow plants in these conditions?;8;44
5418;0uCaKKqoPSk;0uCaKKqoPSk-8-rgb_front;0uCaKKqoPSk_5;0uCaKKqoPSk_5-8-rgb_front;28.99;33.37;So my theory on all of that is don't fix it.;8;11
5419;0uCaKKqoPSk;0uCaKKqoPSk-8-rgb_front;0uCaKKqoPSk_6;0uCaKKqoPSk_6-8-rgb_front;33.81;37.68;Work on top of it or dig some of it out and put some good soil in.;8;17
5420;0uCaKKqoPSk;0uCaKKqoPSk-8-rgb_front;0uCaKKqoPSk_7;0uCaKKqoPSk_7-8-rgb_front;38.17;44.1;It doesn't matter what you have it is going to be good on the bottom so especially clay or sand it is great.;8;23
5421;0uCaKKqoPSk;0uCaKKqoPSk-8-rgb_front;0uCaKKqoPSk_8;0uCaKKqoPSk_8-8-rgb_front;44.63;66.11;Well clay has drainage in the fact that if you put a big raised bed above it the water will just kind of go underneath the clay and leave the bag so your plant is pretty much just going to stay dry because they are up above the clay or if you have sand there is great drainage there so you don't have good soil so if you put a raised bed on top of that sand then you have got great soil with great drainage and everything is going to do really well.;8;94
5422;0uCaKKqoPSk;0uCaKKqoPSk-8-rgb_front;0uCaKKqoPSk_9;0uCaKKqoPSk_9-8-rgb_front;67.11;69.93;So pretty much you cannot fix your bad soil, give it up.;8;12
5440;0v1XIVZ_GzM;0v1XIVZ_GzM-8-rgb_front;0v1XIVZ_GzM_0;0v1XIVZ_GzM_0-8-rgb_front;1.81;5.98;My name is Anthony Maddaloni and I'm going to be talking about photography lighting accessories.;8;15

5445;0v1XIVZ_GzM;0v1XIVZ_GzM-8-rgb_front;0v1XIVZ_GzM_2;0v1XIVZ_GzM_2-8-rgb_front;11.62;13.13;Mainly using lighting.;8;3
5446;0v1XIVZ_GzM;0v1XIVZ_GzM-8-rgb_front;0v1XIVZ_GzM_3;0v1XIVZ_GzM_3-8-rgb_front;13.78;20.89;One is obviously a flash and the other is actually called a radio slave which I used to like to incorporate in my photography a lot.;8;26
5447;0v1XIVZ_GzM;0v1XIVZ_GzM-8-rgb_front;0v1XIVZ_GzM_4;0v1XIVZ_GzM_4-8-rgb_front;20.95;40.06;Now a radio slave is a type of flash that is triggered by frequencies that get put out by the flash on your camera so if I was photographing an event and I wanted a little bit of a fill flash to lighten up the background as my camera flash went off, that flash would go off in the background too.;8;61
5448;0v1XIVZ_GzM;0v1XIVZ_GzM-8-rgb_front;0v1XIVZ_GzM_5;0v1XIVZ_GzM_5-8-rgb_front;40.49;44.26;That was really one of my favorite lighting accessories to use.;8;11
5449;0v1XIVZ_GzM;0v1XIVZ_GzM-8-rgb_front;0v1XIVZ_GzM_6;0v1XIVZ_GzM_6-8-rgb_front;44.61;52.1;One lighting accessory that you can also use is a sink chord which you can attach to your flash unit so you can hold it off camera.;8;27
5450;0v1XIVZ_GzM;0v1XIVZ_GzM-8-rgb_front;0v1XIVZ_GzM_7;0v1XIVZ_GzM_7-8-rgb_front;52.54;67.45;Now one really cool thing about that is that you can essentially use your flash and you can bounce it off of low ceilings thus not giving such a harsh lighting effect when people use on camera flash.;8;38
5451;0v1XIVZ_GzM;0v1XIVZ_GzM-8-rgb_front;0v1XIVZ_GzM_8;0v1XIVZ_GzM_8-8-rgb_front;67.82;70.84;Those are pretty essential accessories to me.;8;7

5502;0vHattAvsqk;0vHattAvsqk-8-rgb_front;0vHattAvsqk_20;0vHattAvsqk_20-8-rgb_front;58.36;63.15;That your going to really want to get comfortable before you actually get going on your unicycle.;8;17

5504;0vHattAvsqk;0vHattAvsqk-8-rgb_front;0vHattAvsqk_22;0vHattAvsqk_22-8-rgb_front;65.75;66.65;Do your walks.;8;3
5505;0vHattAvsqk;0vHattAvsqk-8-rgb_front;0vHattAvsqk_23;0vHattAvsqk_23-8-rgb_front;66.79;72.28;After while start walking with your pedals at three and nine-o-clock.;8;11
5506;0vHattAvsqk;0vHattAvsqk-8-rgb_front;0vHattAvsqk_24;0vHattAvsqk_24-8-rgb_front;72.69;76.79;This is going to help you get a little more uncomfortable with it.;8;13

5508;0vHattAvsqk;0vHattAvsqk-8-rgb_front;0vHattAvsqk_26;0vHattAvsqk_26-8-rgb_front;82.11;90.6;And a good one to do is to stand up on it, and use your handle to get really familiar with the top of the unicycle here.;8;27
5509;0vHattAvsqk;0vHattAvsqk-8-rgb_front;0vHattAvsqk_3;0vHattAvsqk_3-8-rgb_front;12.47;14.44;So, we found a wall right here.;8;7
5510;0vHattAvsqk;0vHattAvsqk-8-rgb_front;0vHattAvsqk_4;0vHattAvsqk_4-8-rgb_front;14.44;16.68;We have not started rolling yet.;8;6

5513;0vHattAvsqk;0vHattAvsqk-8-rgb_front;0vHattAvsqk_7;0vHattAvsqk_7-8-rgb_front;26.8;27.64;Hundred right.;8;2
5514;0vHattAvsqk;0vHattAvsqk-8-rgb_front;0vHattAvsqk_8;0vHattAvsqk_8-8-rgb_front;28.0;28.7;Hundred left.;8;2
5515;0vHattAvsqk;0vHattAvsqk-8-rgb_front;0vHattAvsqk_9;0vHattAvsqk_9-8-rgb_front;29.38;31.32;Then a hundred right like this.;8;6
5516;0vNfEYst_tQ;0vNfEYst_tQ-8-rgb_front;0vNfEYst_tQ_10;0vNfEYst_tQ_10-8-rgb_front;51.4;60.27;So you want to have the strap, the loop in front, and then bring the tail through, so that you're pulling back.;8;22
5517;0vNfEYst_tQ;0vNfEYst_tQ-8-rgb_front;0vNfEYst_tQ_11;0vNfEYst_tQ_11-8-rgb_front;60.3;62.63;So this is an external rotation.;8;6
5518;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_0;0veHGYSKaDc_0-8-rgb_front;4.21;6.63;Hello, I'm Sifu Mallon with the Clearwater Kung Fu center.;8;10
5519;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_1;0veHGYSKaDc_1-8-rgb_front;6.69;9.09;This is my assistant Melissa, and this is kick boxing.;8;10
5520;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_10;0veHGYSKaDc_10-8-rgb_front;30.45;37.02;Again with this, I'm staying stationary, right, but I'm still on my hips, and my legs can move in the side to side action.;8;24
5521;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_11;0veHGYSKaDc_11-8-rgb_front;37.9;43.8;As I'm pushing from one side to the other, I don't want to straighten my leg completely up, but I do want to push a little bit up.;8;28
5522;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_12;0veHGYSKaDc_12-8-rgb_front;44.91;48.17;Up, up, has this nice twisting action.;8;7
5523;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_13;0veHGYSKaDc_13-8-rgb_front;48.68;50.5;OK Melissa let's go ahead and come forward.;8;8
5524;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_14;0veHGYSKaDc_14-8-rgb_front;51.0;52.41;And we'll do the pad drill with each other.;8;9
5525;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_15;0veHGYSKaDc_15-8-rgb_front;52.41;54.03;So we start with our feet shoulder width apart.;8;9
5526;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_16;0veHGYSKaDc_16-8-rgb_front;55.65;58.0;OK our hands are up, right, I'm putting a little bit back.;8;12
5527;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_17;0veHGYSKaDc_17-8-rgb_front;58.47;65.38;OK, now to start the action, she's going to turn in this way slightly, she's going to allow this hand to kind of roll down a little bit, and then fire up.;8;32
5528;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_18;0veHGYSKaDc_18-8-rgb_front;65.67;66.03;Good.;8;1
5529;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_19;0veHGYSKaDc_19-8-rgb_front;66.44;73.7;Now, once she makes contact with the pad, she's going to left it up here, and then the hand is going to come straight back, not loop up, but straight back to her this way.;8;35
5530;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_2;0veHGYSKaDc_2-8-rgb_front;9.48;11.5;We're working on pad drills today.;8;6
5531;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_20;0veHGYSKaDc_20-8-rgb_front;73.7;77.41;And then she's going to fire the other hand straight up and pull it straight in.;8;16
5532;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_21;0veHGYSKaDc_21-8-rgb_front;78.32;83.79;Now she wants to use the body, you want to dip the hand a little lower before you punch out, that's it.;8;22
5533;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_22;0veHGYSKaDc_22-8-rgb_front;85.51;86.75;And I'm looking for the center.;8;6
5534;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_23;0veHGYSKaDc_23-8-rgb_front;87.64;89.37;And meeting that hand each time.;8;6
5535;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_24;0veHGYSKaDc_24-8-rgb_front;92.88;93.68;That's it.;8;2
5536;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_25;0veHGYSKaDc_25-8-rgb_front;94.15;95.05;Good, relax.;8;2
5537;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_26;0veHGYSKaDc_26-8-rgb_front;95.27;102.2;Again, my elbows are into the body this way, and I'm working the technique, boom, this way, this way, keeping my elbows nice and tight.;8;25
5538;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_27;0veHGYSKaDc_27-8-rgb_front;102.55;110.38;For the punch, you're performing the uppercuts, we want to remember to twist a little, drop the hand a little low, like rotating it, and fire up.;8;27
5539;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_28;0veHGYSKaDc_28-8-rgb_front;110.83;115.37;The hand comes straight back this way, the left hand drops down, I use the twist this way.;8;18
5540;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_29;0veHGYSKaDc_29-8-rgb_front;116.26;121.25;So there's a nice counter action with your body, so there's a lot of body mechanics going on in these basic drills.;8;22
5541;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_3;0veHGYSKaDc_3-8-rgb_front;11.74;14.27;The pad drill that we're going to begin with is our uppercut drill.;8;13
5542;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_30;0veHGYSKaDc_30-8-rgb_front;122.08;125.56;This is basic drill combos, kick boxing.;8;7
5543;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_4;0veHGYSKaDc_4-8-rgb_front;14.34;16.25;OK, this one is a stationary drill.;8;7
5544;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_5;0veHGYSKaDc_5-8-rgb_front;16.53;18.09;OK just going through the action with it.;8;8
5545;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_6;0veHGYSKaDc_6-8-rgb_front;18.09;19.68;I'll start with my feet shoulder width apart.;8;8
5546;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_7;0veHGYSKaDc_7-8-rgb_front;20.98;25.05;I'll twist to my left, OK twist to my left, and I'll fire my left hand up.;8;17
5547;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_8;0veHGYSKaDc_8-8-rgb_front;25.21;25.5;Boom.;8;1
5548;0veHGYSKaDc;0veHGYSKaDc-8-rgb_front;0veHGYSKaDc_9;0veHGYSKaDc_9-8-rgb_front;26.13;30.21;I bring my left hand to body, my left, right hand drops down, fire to right.;8;16
5549;0vgVGyIjRAM;0vgVGyIjRAM-8-rgb_front;0vgVGyIjRAM_1;0vgVGyIjRAM_1-8-rgb_front;9.52;12.56;Of course, this is fencing and so the blade does come into play.;8;13
5550;0vgVGyIjRAM;0vgVGyIjRAM-8-rgb_front;0vgVGyIjRAM_2;0vgVGyIjRAM_2-8-rgb_front;12.91;20.26;So when we are protecting ourself, one, we're looking to protect ourselves with our feet, but two, we do look to protect ourselves with our blade.;8;26
5551;0vgVGyIjRAM;0vgVGyIjRAM-8-rgb_front;0vgVGyIjRAM_3;0vgVGyIjRAM_3-8-rgb_front;20.32;21.4;This is called parrying.;8;4
5552;0vgVGyIjRAM;0vgVGyIjRAM-8-rgb_front;0vgVGyIjRAM_4;0vgVGyIjRAM_4-8-rgb_front;21.49;24.61;"We use our blade to protect ourselves from our opponent's attack; it's called parrying.";8;14
5553;0vgVGyIjRAM;0vgVGyIjRAM-8-rgb_front;0vgVGyIjRAM_5;0vgVGyIjRAM_5-8-rgb_front;25.03;29.6;There are several parries depending on where opponent's attacking and what we're trying to do.;8;15
5554;0vgVGyIjRAM;0vgVGyIjRAM-8-rgb_front;0vgVGyIjRAM_6;0vgVGyIjRAM_6-8-rgb_front;29.6;37.72;We may do one of several parries that allow us to stop the opponent's blade, and then make a riposte, or to hit them after we've protected ourselves.;8;28
5555;0vgVGyIjRAM;0vgVGyIjRAM-8-rgb_front;0vgVGyIjRAM_7;0vgVGyIjRAM_7-8-rgb_front;37.94;45.31;It can be done in place with maneuvering forward, backward, even sometimes with a lunge, depending on the needs and the tactical situation.;8;23
5556;0vgVGyIjRAM;0vgVGyIjRAM-8-rgb_front;0vgVGyIjRAM_8;0vgVGyIjRAM_8-8-rgb_front;45.58;51.38;We'll go over three of the most important parries in sabre one at a time and how and when to use them.;8;22
5557;0vgVGyIjRAM;0vgVGyIjRAM-8-rgb_front;0vgVGyIjRAM_9;0vgVGyIjRAM_9-8-rgb_front;51.79;58.38;I'll show you these from different angles as well, different parries we might use, like so.;8;16
5558;0vmzETHEVwg;0vmzETHEVwg-8-rgb_front;0vmzETHEVwg_0;0vmzETHEVwg_0-8-rgb_front;0.31;3.33;Hi, I'm Natanya Nielsen from Saratoga Springs, Utah.;8;8
5559;0vmzETHEVwg;0vmzETHEVwg-8-rgb_front;0vmzETHEVwg_1;0vmzETHEVwg_1-8-rgb_front;3.6;8.14;Today we're going to talk about crochet basics, and we're going to start with the chain stitch.;8;17
5560;0vmzETHEVwg;0vmzETHEVwg-8-rgb_front;0vmzETHEVwg_10;0vmzETHEVwg_10-8-rgb_front;57.73;67.11;As your chain gets longer, simply slide your fingers towards your hook to help hold it stable, to help keep your stitches the same length.;8;25
5561;0vmzETHEVwg;0vmzETHEVwg-8-rgb_front;0vmzETHEVwg_11;0vmzETHEVwg_11-8-rgb_front;67.71;78.65;You want to practice being loose and controlled and relaxed as you do this, because the looser your chain is, the easier it is to continue your project.;8;28
5562;0vmzETHEVwg;0vmzETHEVwg-8-rgb_front;0vmzETHEVwg_2;0vmzETHEVwg_2-8-rgb_front;8.62;13.38;We start with a slip stitch.;8;6
5563;0vmzETHEVwg;0vmzETHEVwg-8-rgb_front;0vmzETHEVwg_3;0vmzETHEVwg_3-8-rgb_front;14.21;23.28;To do your slip stitch, you're going to lay your yarn over top of your pinkie, wrap it around the back of your hand, and grasp it between your middle finger and your thumb.;8;34
5564;0vmzETHEVwg;0vmzETHEVwg-8-rgb_front;0vmzETHEVwg_4;0vmzETHEVwg_4-8-rgb_front;24.03;27.38;Take your hook and lay it underneath your yarn.;8;9
5565;0vmzETHEVwg;0vmzETHEVwg-8-rgb_front;0vmzETHEVwg_5;0vmzETHEVwg_5-8-rgb_front;28.2;35.09;Then you'll twist it all the way around, grab your yarn with your hook, and pull it through the loop.;8;20
5566;0vmzETHEVwg;0vmzETHEVwg-8-rgb_front;0vmzETHEVwg_6;0vmzETHEVwg_6-8-rgb_front;35.75;38.85;Pull that loop tight, and you have your slip stitch.;8;10
5567;0vmzETHEVwg;0vmzETHEVwg-8-rgb_front;0vmzETHEVwg_7;0vmzETHEVwg_7-8-rgb_front;39.12;50.09;To start your chain stitch, you're going to grab the yarn with the hook part of your crochet hook, then you'll pull that through the loop that's already on your hook.;8;31
5568;0vmzETHEVwg;0vmzETHEVwg-8-rgb_front;0vmzETHEVwg_8;0vmzETHEVwg_8-8-rgb_front;51.17;53.2;And you will have another loop on your hook.;8;9
5569;0vmzETHEVwg;0vmzETHEVwg-8-rgb_front;0vmzETHEVwg_9;0vmzETHEVwg_9-8-rgb_front;53.59;56.92;You do the same thing over and over again.;8;9
5570;0vygqtVIP-s;0vygqtVIP-s-8-rgb_front;0vygqtVIP-s_0;0vygqtVIP-s_0-8-rgb_front;0.45;6.97;So, hopefully, now that you know how to do the frontwards weave, putting it all together into the backwards weave will be a snap.;8;24
5571;0vygqtVIP-s;0vygqtVIP-s-8-rgb_front;0vygqtVIP-s_1;0vygqtVIP-s_1-8-rgb_front;7.47;17.06;Let's start by split time circles just like we did before and we're going to try one continuous cycle and then going back to split time circles.;8;27
5572;0vygqtVIP-s;0vygqtVIP-s-8-rgb_front;0vygqtVIP-s_10;0vygqtVIP-s_10-8-rgb_front;65.27;68.79;Think of them going under the other one.;8;8
5573;0vygqtVIP-s;0vygqtVIP-s-8-rgb_front;0vygqtVIP-s_11;0vygqtVIP-s_11-8-rgb_front;69.35;69.78;Under.;8;1

5575;0vygqtVIP-s;0vygqtVIP-s-8-rgb_front;0vygqtVIP-s_2;0vygqtVIP-s_2-8-rgb_front;17.56;19.42;Starting with my right arm.;8;5
5576;0vygqtVIP-s;0vygqtVIP-s-8-rgb_front;0vygqtVIP-s_3;0vygqtVIP-s_3-8-rgb_front;21.39;23.47;One whole weave and then back.;8;6
5577;0vygqtVIP-s;0vygqtVIP-s-8-rgb_front;0vygqtVIP-s_4;0vygqtVIP-s_4-8-rgb_front;24.22;27.96;So again, each hand gets a chance to be on top.;8;11
5578;0vygqtVIP-s;0vygqtVIP-s-8-rgb_front;0vygqtVIP-s_5;0vygqtVIP-s_5-8-rgb_front;31.31;34.72;My wrists are moving under each other as they cross.;8;10
5579;0vygqtVIP-s;0vygqtVIP-s-8-rgb_front;0vygqtVIP-s_6;0vygqtVIP-s_6-8-rgb_front;35.24;35.85;Under.;8;1

5581;0vygqtVIP-s;0vygqtVIP-s-8-rgb_front;0vygqtVIP-s_8;0vygqtVIP-s_8-8-rgb_front;43.07;48.66;This will enable you to do it without your Poi crossing and tangling with one another.;8;16
5582;0vygqtVIP-s;0vygqtVIP-s-8-rgb_front;0vygqtVIP-s_9;0vygqtVIP-s_9-8-rgb_front;55.22;64.63;If you get confused, just come back to split time circles and try again, starting with your right hand leading up to your left shoulder and around.;8;27
5583;0w4x3Eb0Tvs;0w4x3Eb0Tvs-8-rgb_front;0w4x3Eb0Tvs_0;0w4x3Eb0Tvs_0-8-rgb_front;0.35;3.52;This is standard relaxation therapy for the low back.;8;9
5584;0w4x3Eb0Tvs;0w4x3Eb0Tvs-8-rgb_front;0w4x3Eb0Tvs_1;0w4x3Eb0Tvs_1-8-rgb_front;3.87;11.74;A lot of people have low back problems and the low back is an area that often times doesn't get as much attention as it deserves.;8;26
5585;0w4x3Eb0Tvs;0w4x3Eb0Tvs-8-rgb_front;0w4x3Eb0Tvs_10;0w4x3Eb0Tvs_10-8-rgb_front;52.76;58.08;Again be careful going across the base of the spine and be careful going across the sacrum as well.;8;19

6368;10om04b2LIw;10om04b2LIw-8-rgb_front;10om04b2LIw_22;10om04b2LIw_22-8-rgb_front;116.76;118.76;To really show that this is in fact a fly.;8;10

6371;10om04b2LIw;10om04b2LIw-8-rgb_front;10om04b2LIw_25;10om04b2LIw_25-8-rgb_front;134.79;136.37;Reinforce your lines.;8;3

6384;11G4WcABMWQ;11G4WcABMWQ-8-rgb_front;11G4WcABMWQ_2;11G4WcABMWQ_2-8-rgb_front;14.09;24.26;The capelet part of it is because it's going to be set on top and go down the shoulders like a capelet.;8;22

6387;11G4WcABMWQ;11G4WcABMWQ-8-rgb_front;11G4WcABMWQ_5;11G4WcABMWQ_5-8-rgb_front;43.32;50.14;That just creates something that has more design lines on it than anything else.;8;14

6433;11YPOdiY44o;11YPOdiY44o-8-rgb_front;11YPOdiY44o_8;11YPOdiY44o_8-8-rgb_front;69.23;76.2;Once you get to the prerealese level, you may be fortunate enough to stay in a room with maybe only 4 or 3 other people, a 4 man room total.;8;30

6436;11YofC1i8zc;11YofC1i8zc-8-rgb_front;11YofC1i8zc_1;11YofC1i8zc_1-8-rgb_front;4.48;6.46;We are talking about all levels.;8;6
6437;11YofC1i8zc;11YofC1i8zc-8-rgb_front;11YofC1i8zc_10;11YofC1i8zc_10-8-rgb_front;48.81;50.02;So we will see what he does right here.;8;9
6438;11YofC1i8zc;11YofC1i8zc-8-rgb_front;11YofC1i8zc_11;11YofC1i8zc_11-8-rgb_front;50.02;52.99;His first move, he is stepping out and then he runs.;8;11
6439;11YofC1i8zc;11YofC1i8zc-8-rgb_front;11YofC1i8zc_12;11YofC1i8zc_12-8-rgb_front;52.99;56.63;He turns his upper body right away, he runs over.;8;10
6440;11YofC1i8zc;11YofC1i8zc-8-rgb_front;11YofC1i8zc_13;11YofC1i8zc_13-8-rgb_front;56.63;59.45;Step out, and then the run.;8;6
6441;11YofC1i8zc;11YofC1i8zc-8-rgb_front;11YofC1i8zc_14;11YofC1i8zc_14-8-rgb_front;59.45;60.77;See that, a lot quicker.;8;5
6442;11YofC1i8zc;11YofC1i8zc-8-rgb_front;11YofC1i8zc_15;11YofC1i8zc_15-8-rgb_front;60.77;86.72;He is going to be able to get there a lot earlier, and when you are there early, you have options.;8;21
6443;11YofC1i8zc;11YofC1i8zc-8-rgb_front;11YofC1i8zc_16;11YofC1i8zc_16-8-rgb_front;87.03;88.32;That is very, very important right there.;8;7
6444;11YofC1i8zc;11YofC1i8zc-8-rgb_front;11YofC1i8zc_2;11YofC1i8zc_2-8-rgb_front;6.46;11.3;Club players sometimes, even tournament players in their first move to the ball.;8;13
6445;11YofC1i8zc;11YofC1i8zc-8-rgb_front;11YofC1i8zc_3;11YofC1i8zc_3-8-rgb_front;11.3;19.73;A lot of players will just shuffle to the ball, making them a lot slower and they do not get their rotation, and by the time they get to the ball they are playing catch-up.;8;35
6446;11YofC1i8zc;11YofC1i8zc-8-rgb_front;11YofC1i8zc_4;11YofC1i8zc_4-8-rgb_front;20.43;21.26;So watch this.;8;3
6447;11YofC1i8zc;11YofC1i8zc-8-rgb_front;11YofC1i8zc_5;11YofC1i8zc_5-8-rgb_front;21.26;22.36;This is the common mistake.;8;5
6448;11YofC1i8zc;11YofC1i8zc-8-rgb_front;11YofC1i8zc_6;11YofC1i8zc_6-8-rgb_front;22.36;31.9;See how he is shuffling to the ball, he cannot get in position, does not get his feet organized to the ball, and he is doing the crab walk.;8;29
6449;11YofC1i8zc;11YofC1i8zc-8-rgb_front;11YofC1i8zc_7;11YofC1i8zc_7-8-rgb_front;31.9;32.81;It does not even look good.;8;6
6450;11YofC1i8zc;11YofC1i8zc-8-rgb_front;11YofC1i8zc_8;11YofC1i8zc_8-8-rgb_front;33.53;38.87;So now we will show you what you want to do, as opposed to that.;8;15
6451;11YofC1i8zc;11YofC1i8zc-8-rgb_front;11YofC1i8zc_9;11YofC1i8zc_9-8-rgb_front;38.9;48.81;The movement is that the first move has to be a step out, your right foot is going to come out of the forehand side, you are getting your rotation, and then you can officially run to the ball and not shuffle to the ball.;8;45
6452;11aqPfA6Zgo;11aqPfA6Zgo-8-rgb_front;11aqPfA6Zgo_0;11aqPfA6Zgo_0-8-rgb_front;1.99;4.05;Alright, we've introduce forward rolling.;8;5
6453;11aqPfA6Zgo;11aqPfA6Zgo-8-rgb_front;11aqPfA6Zgo_1;11aqPfA6Zgo_1-8-rgb_front;5.31;6.8;So let's continue along that vein.;8;6
6454;11aqPfA6Zgo;11aqPfA6Zgo-8-rgb_front;11aqPfA6Zgo_10;11aqPfA6Zgo_10-8-rgb_front;53.11;69.41;So you have to maintain and you have to be completely and totally aware that when you are forward rolling, hands are down, stand up, make sure that there's inner-abdominal strength and stability in this area.;8;36
6455;11aqPfA6Zgo;11aqPfA6Zgo-8-rgb_front;11aqPfA6Zgo_11;11aqPfA6Zgo_11-8-rgb_front;70.28;70.66;Okay.;8;1
6456;11aqPfA6Zgo;11aqPfA6Zgo-8-rgb_front;11aqPfA6Zgo_12;11aqPfA6Zgo_12-8-rgb_front;71.12;74.93;So always roll, it's always a ball, it's always form and fashion of a ball.;8;15
6457;11aqPfA6Zgo;11aqPfA6Zgo-8-rgb_front;11aqPfA6Zgo_13;11aqPfA6Zgo_13-8-rgb_front;74.93;76.08;The function of a ball.;8;5
6458;11aqPfA6Zgo;11aqPfA6Zgo-8-rgb_front;11aqPfA6Zgo_14;11aqPfA6Zgo_14-8-rgb_front;76.77;87.44;So, now I mean it's not complex, but it doesn't feel very good when you mess it up.;8;18
6459;11aqPfA6Zgo;11aqPfA6Zgo-8-rgb_front;11aqPfA6Zgo_15;11aqPfA6Zgo_15-8-rgb_front;88.34;89.18;So, one more time.;8;4
6460;11aqPfA6Zgo;11aqPfA6Zgo-8-rgb_front;11aqPfA6Zgo_16;11aqPfA6Zgo_16-8-rgb_front;90.94;99.78;Forward roll, you should come up to the exact same position you started at, for right now.;8;17
6461;11aqPfA6Zgo;11aqPfA6Zgo-8-rgb_front;11aqPfA6Zgo_2;11aqPfA6Zgo_2-8-rgb_front;9.8;14.16;The principle of rolling is that of a ball, meaning you roll a ball.;8;14
6462;11aqPfA6Zgo;11aqPfA6Zgo-8-rgb_front;11aqPfA6Zgo_3;11aqPfA6Zgo_3-8-rgb_front;15.11;18.31;A ball rolls rather redundant.;8;5
6463;11aqPfA6Zgo;11aqPfA6Zgo-8-rgb_front;11aqPfA6Zgo_4;11aqPfA6Zgo_4-8-rgb_front;19.28;26.95;Needless to say, on this the things you have to be very aware of is you have to be aware of where your hips are.;8;25
6464;11aqPfA6Zgo;11aqPfA6Zgo-8-rgb_front;11aqPfA6Zgo_5;11aqPfA6Zgo_5-8-rgb_front;27.16;36.61;A very common issue, a very common problem that people encounter is that when they're rolling they have a tendency to lose that structure.;8;24
6465;11aqPfA6Zgo;11aqPfA6Zgo-8-rgb_front;11aqPfA6Zgo_6;11aqPfA6Zgo_6-8-rgb_front;36.99;39.39;And to lose the inner-abdominal strength.;8;6
6466;11aqPfA6Zgo;11aqPfA6Zgo-8-rgb_front;11aqPfA6Zgo_7;11aqPfA6Zgo_7-8-rgb_front;40.02;46.79;And so it causes the hip to flop, and you get a hip that lands hard or the feet fly out.;8;21
6467;11aqPfA6Zgo;11aqPfA6Zgo-8-rgb_front;11aqPfA6Zgo_8;11aqPfA6Zgo_8-8-rgb_front;47.04;50.16;Things happen, people get hurt, you twist the back or something.;8;11
6468;11aqPfA6Zgo;11aqPfA6Zgo-8-rgb_front;11aqPfA6Zgo_9;11aqPfA6Zgo_9-8-rgb_front;50.35;52.14;Those are the most common injuries to occur.;8;8
6469;11b-DjymB2M;11b-DjymB2M-8-rgb_front;11b-DjymB2M_0;11b-DjymB2M_0-8-rgb_front;0.1;3.96;Now, let me show you how to add a little color to the windmill.;8;14
6470;11b-DjymB2M;11b-DjymB2M-8-rgb_front;11b-DjymB2M_1;11b-DjymB2M_1-8-rgb_front;4.47;35.16;We're going to decorate the roof, we'll make a few decorations, but first we'll decorate the roof and we're going to use our match sticks again, the way we do is this is, we coat the top of the milk carton that angles down with glue, and we can either brush it on with a paint brush or we can have the kids, who are doing the project, if they want to just smear with their finger and while it's still wet.;8;82
6471;11b-DjymB2M;11b-DjymB2M-8-rgb_front;11b-DjymB2M_2;11b-DjymB2M_2-8-rgb_front;35.16;52.77;We lay across the match sticks, we use a solid color, be kind of like a red tile roof, so we choose for this project all the red match sticks and we'll lay them across the top of the milk carton.;8;41
6472;11b-DjymB2M;11b-DjymB2M-8-rgb_front;11b-DjymB2M_3;11b-DjymB2M_3-8-rgb_front;55.02;64.54;Using the solid color is recommended because we have a lot of colors on the arms of the windmill, so we don't want to make it too busy.;8;28
6473;11b-DjymB2M;11b-DjymB2M-8-rgb_front;11b-DjymB2M_4;11b-DjymB2M_4-8-rgb_front;65.59;72.47;And the red, itself, also, gives a nice realistic touch to it that it looks, actually, like a roof.;8;19
6474;11b-DjymB2M;11b-DjymB2M-8-rgb_front;11b-DjymB2M_5;11b-DjymB2M_5-8-rgb_front;73.22;109.46;So, the match sticks, actually, fit nicely across the top of the windmill, they don't have to fit exactly the same measurement as the top of the carton, but if you lay them across, if you double them up, even though they hang over a little bit, they still fit nicely onto the side of the milk carton, and we only have to do one side, the side, obviously, in the front, that's going to be seen, and we go all the way down to the bottom of where it angles, and starts going vertical again.;8;96
6475;11b-DjymB2M;11b-DjymB2M-8-rgb_front;11b-DjymB2M_6;11b-DjymB2M_6-8-rgb_front;111.4;128.26;This is really just for decoration and it's not a necessary part of the project, obviously, if you want to paint directly onto the milk carton, different designs or different types of pictures, you could also do that.;8;38
6476;11b-DjymB2M;11b-DjymB2M-8-rgb_front;11b-DjymB2M_7;11b-DjymB2M_7-8-rgb_front;129.78;133.82;So, here is our red tile roof for our windmill.;8;10
6477;11bX6_dM6UQ;11bX6_dM6UQ-8-rgb_front;11bX6_dM6UQ_1;11bX6_dM6UQ_1-8-rgb_front;7.03;26.47;"So, still working with the hand and working each finger individually is going to help benefit not only the hand itself and the bones and joints and muscles of the hand, but also again tapping into the connection with the thumb; the next finger to the collarbone; the pinkie to the heart; and the other three fingers that dive right directly into the shoulder socket.";8;65
6478;11bX6_dM6UQ;11bX6_dM6UQ-8-rgb_front;11bX6_dM6UQ_10;11bX6_dM6UQ_10-8-rgb_front;61.84;63.35;It feels really good.;8;4
6479;11bX6_dM6UQ;11bX6_dM6UQ-8-rgb_front;11bX6_dM6UQ_2;11bX6_dM6UQ_2-8-rgb_front;26.94;32.37;So, you can move each finger independently of the others in a stretching fashion.;8;14
6480;11bX6_dM6UQ;11bX6_dM6UQ-8-rgb_front;11bX6_dM6UQ_3;11bX6_dM6UQ_3-8-rgb_front;32.37;35.0;And I'm supporting from the underside with my thumb.;8;9
6481;11bX6_dM6UQ;11bX6_dM6UQ-8-rgb_front;11bX6_dM6UQ_4;11bX6_dM6UQ_4-8-rgb_front;35.41;37.55;I'm making this look easy.;8;5
6482;11bX6_dM6UQ;11bX6_dM6UQ-8-rgb_front;11bX6_dM6UQ_5;11bX6_dM6UQ_5-8-rgb_front;37.55;43.88;I have quite a bit of range in my hands because this is something that I do weekly if not almost daily.;8;22
6483;11bX6_dM6UQ;11bX6_dM6UQ-8-rgb_front;11bX6_dM6UQ_6;11bX6_dM6UQ_6-8-rgb_front;44.27;48.52;Important is the thumb, right, because he's always in this position.;8;11
6484;11bX6_dM6UQ;11bX6_dM6UQ-8-rgb_front;11bX6_dM6UQ_7;11bX6_dM6UQ_7-8-rgb_front;48.73;51.91;So this thenar muscle really needs to get a stretch.;8;10
6485;11bX6_dM6UQ;11bX6_dM6UQ-8-rgb_front;11bX6_dM6UQ_8;11bX6_dM6UQ_8-8-rgb_front;52.09;59.69;And you can see, when you come out of these stretches, how red the hand gets because we're generating some good circulation.;8;22
6486;11bX6_dM6UQ;11bX6_dM6UQ-8-rgb_front;11bX6_dM6UQ_9;11bX6_dM6UQ_9-8-rgb_front;59.99;61.37;So, it gets flushed with blood.;8;6
6487;11cwpeaDJzc;11cwpeaDJzc-8-rgb_front;11cwpeaDJzc_0;11cwpeaDJzc_0-8-rgb_front;1.36;4.85;Have you ever wondered on how often you should wear your night guard?;8;13
6488;11cwpeaDJzc;11cwpeaDJzc-8-rgb_front;11cwpeaDJzc_1;11cwpeaDJzc_1-8-rgb_front;5.16;10.12;Well my name is Michelle and I'm a dental assistant with Solutionz and I'm here to explain to you on how often you should wear it.;8;26
6489;11cwpeaDJzc;11cwpeaDJzc-8-rgb_front;11cwpeaDJzc_2;11cwpeaDJzc_2-8-rgb_front;10.78;23.68;Basically if you have been prescribed by your general dentist to wear a night guard because you tend to maybe grind your teeth at night, or to wear a night guard during the day while you're driving 'cause you get tense and you grind your teeth.;8;46
6490;11cwpeaDJzc;11cwpeaDJzc-8-rgb_front;11cwpeaDJzc_3;11cwpeaDJzc_3-8-rgb_front;24.45;30.43;But that's something - wearing a night guard is something you definitely want to wear on a consistent basis every night.;8;21
6491;11cwpeaDJzc;11cwpeaDJzc-8-rgb_front;11cwpeaDJzc_4;11cwpeaDJzc_4-8-rgb_front;30.43;40.94;It's pretty easy after you brush and floss your teeth before you go to bed, you just pop in your night guard, wear it for those eight hours or six hours of sleep that you're getting.;8;36
6492;11cwpeaDJzc;11cwpeaDJzc-8-rgb_front;11cwpeaDJzc_5;11cwpeaDJzc_5-8-rgb_front;41.11;52.07;And then take it out in the morning, rinse it off, even maybe you know rinse it off with your toothbrush and toothpaste, to kind of keep it clean of that excess film that you might have left on it.;8;40
6493;11cwpeaDJzc;11cwpeaDJzc-8-rgb_front;11cwpeaDJzc_6;11cwpeaDJzc_6-8-rgb_front;52.39;67.03;But if you've been prescribed by your general dentist to wear a night guard you definitely want to wear it every night on a regular basis because by doing so you're going to be training your actual jaw joints to kind of not become so tense.;8;46
6494;11cwpeaDJzc;11cwpeaDJzc-8-rgb_front;11cwpeaDJzc_7;11cwpeaDJzc_7-8-rgb_front;67.26;86.75;You have to basically you're retraining those TMJ joints to kind of stay propped open and you're providing cushion for them, so the more that you can wear it the better it will be for you in the long run, but yes, every night definitely wear your night guard if you've been prescribed to wear it during driving, every time you get in the car, pop it in.;8;68
6495;11cwpeaDJzc;11cwpeaDJzc-8-rgb_front;11cwpeaDJzc_8;11cwpeaDJzc_8-8-rgb_front;86.75;89.92;It's only going to be a benefit for you in the future.;8;12
6496;11cwpeaDJzc;11cwpeaDJzc-8-rgb_front;11cwpeaDJzc_9;11cwpeaDJzc_9-8-rgb_front;90.22;95.61;Once again my name is Michelle and I'm a dental assistant with Solutionz, and I just explained to you on how often to wear your night guard.;8;27
6497;11dfT7iY3kI;11dfT7iY3kI-8-rgb_front;11dfT7iY3kI_0;11dfT7iY3kI_0-8-rgb_front;0.1;11.0;Alright, so we've gone over two kinds of naps so far out of the basic upper body hitting type of naps and the third one we're going to go over is the team nap.;8;34
6498;11dfT7iY3kI;11dfT7iY3kI-8-rgb_front;11dfT7iY3kI_1;11dfT7iY3kI_1-8-rgb_front;11.54;17.14;You can use this with punches but usually you use this with just slaps.;8;14
6499;11dfT7iY3kI;11dfT7iY3kI-8-rgb_front;11dfT7iY3kI_2;11dfT7iY3kI_2-8-rgb_front;17.57;26.41;So what's going to happen instead of just Shaun or just me making the sound when the action happens, we're both going to do it together as part of the action.;8;31
6500;11dfT7iY3kI;11dfT7iY3kI-8-rgb_front;11dfT7iY3kI_3;11dfT7iY3kI_3-8-rgb_front;26.97;38.25;So we're going to start off like we always do with making sure we have our distance, eye contact to let each other know that we're going to start the movement, then I'm going to wind up like this.;8;39
6501;11dfT7iY3kI;11dfT7iY3kI-8-rgb_front;11dfT7iY3kI_4;11dfT7iY3kI_4-8-rgb_front;38.65;40.32;Notice where Shaun has his hand.;8;6
6502;11dfT7iY3kI;11dfT7iY3kI-8-rgb_front;11dfT7iY3kI_5;11dfT7iY3kI_5-8-rgb_front;40.87;56.68;Shaun has his hand in place for me to hit it when I do, but he put it on his chest, he didn't put it near his face, he didn't put it out some crazy place, but he put it right there where it could be hidden from the audience and it will still be affective to make the sound.;8;60
6503;11dfT7iY3kI;11dfT7iY3kI-8-rgb_front;11dfT7iY3kI_6;11dfT7iY3kI_6-8-rgb_front;57.09;63.48;So, like I said I'm going to wind up real big, start off real slow, slap and then Shaun's going to react accordingly.;8;23
6504;11dfT7iY3kI;11dfT7iY3kI-8-rgb_front;11dfT7iY3kI_7;11dfT7iY3kI_7-8-rgb_front;64.6;67.07;So let's try that one more time, speed it up a little bit.;8;13
6505;11dfT7iY3kI;11dfT7iY3kI-8-rgb_front;11dfT7iY3kI_8;11dfT7iY3kI_8-8-rgb_front;67.17;85.36;So, put your hand down, remember you don't start with it, so hands on the shoulder establish distance, eye contact, wind up and remember always follow through and until you're ready go only about 75%.;8;35
6506;11iwFCSB038;11iwFCSB038-8-rgb_front;11iwFCSB038_0;11iwFCSB038_0-8-rgb_front;0.1;0.42;Alright.;8;1

6566;11whCAUxiQc;11whCAUxiQc-8-rgb_front;11whCAUxiQc_10;11whCAUxiQc_10-8-rgb_front;91.34;97.91;And I'll probably extend that all the way through the rest of the mural with an idea of trees.;8;19
6567;11whCAUxiQc;11whCAUxiQc-8-rgb_front;11whCAUxiQc_11;11whCAUxiQc_11-8-rgb_front;98.45;109.95;So what you have is this very strong foreground with the tigers and the flowers and the tree, and again, all the flowers with the tiger.;8;26
6568;11whCAUxiQc;11whCAUxiQc-8-rgb_front;11whCAUxiQc_12;11whCAUxiQc_12-8-rgb_front;110.41;117.68;I'm thinking I might put a baby tiger in here as well, so that it looks like mother and baby together and then the tree again.;8;26

6581;11whCAUxiQc;11whCAUxiQc-8-rgb_front;11whCAUxiQc_6;11whCAUxiQc_6-8-rgb_front;53.94;61.03;I'm going to paint a tree coming up so it takes up the whole of that corner.;8;17

6615;12Awan9AIs4;12Awan9AIs4-8-rgb_front;12Awan9AIs4_1;12Awan9AIs4_1-8-rgb_front;11.72;25.66;Drip irrigation is important for a number of things and one of the main reasons is that it supplies an adequate moisture situation to a plant during the growing time without interruption.;8;32
6616;12Awan9AIs4;12Awan9AIs4-8-rgb_front;12Awan9AIs4_2;12Awan9AIs4_2-8-rgb_front;26.31;41.47;You can't rely on the rain and also I think I mentioned before that a raised bed is cut off from the soil in such a way that it doesn't allow moisture to rise from below which happens a lot of times in a natural garden situation.;8;47
6617;12Awan9AIs4;12Awan9AIs4-8-rgb_front;12Awan9AIs4_3;12Awan9AIs4_3-8-rgb_front;42.09;49.94;Even though it is dry on the surface, during the evening and at night, moisture will rise from below and your plants can get a little bit of that moisture.;8;30
6618;12Awan9AIs4;12Awan9AIs4-8-rgb_front;12Awan9AIs4_4;12Awan9AIs4_4-8-rgb_front;50.14;56.58;Where in these beds if they don't come from the top or from artificial means, it ain't going to happen.;8;20
6619;12Awan9AIs4;12Awan9AIs4-8-rgb_front;12Awan9AIs4_5;12Awan9AIs4_5-8-rgb_front;56.61;68.92;So drip irrigation is a serious consideration when it comes to raised beds or any kind of container garden because other wise you are going to be out there every day watering and a lot of people will miss it.;8;40
6620;12Awan9AIs4;12Awan9AIs4-8-rgb_front;12Awan9AIs4_6;12Awan9AIs4_6-8-rgb_front;70.77;72.82;Drip irrigation comes several ways.;8;5
6621;12Awan9AIs4;12Awan9AIs4-8-rgb_front;12Awan9AIs4_7;12Awan9AIs4_7-8-rgb_front;73.03;80.1;We are going to be showing buttonless installation which is a very targeted way of watering.;8;16

6623;12Q2z61azPg;12Q2z61azPg-8-rgb_front;12Q2z61azPg_0;12Q2z61azPg_0-8-rgb_front;1.59;11.18;Now of course the slab roller is the easier way to go, but not everybody owns that piece of equipment, so I'm going to show you how to make a nice slab of clay with just a rolling pin and your table.;8;42
6624;12Q2z61azPg;12Q2z61azPg-8-rgb_front;12Q2z61azPg_1;12Q2z61azPg_1-8-rgb_front;11.51;22.36;Now my table here is covered in canvas, that way when I'm throwing the clay, it's not sticking, it gives it a nice surface to absorb a little bit of the water as well, if you're letting your clay set up.;8;41
6625;12Q2z61azPg;12Q2z61azPg-8-rgb_front;12Q2z61azPg_10;12Q2z61azPg_10-8-rgb_front;96.13;98.63;Helps to, to clean off your knife first.;8;8
6626;12Q2z61azPg;12Q2z61azPg-8-rgb_front;12Q2z61azPg_11;12Q2z61azPg_11-8-rgb_front;99.91;103.81;And you're just compressing the clay and smoothing the surface.;8;10
6627;12Q2z61azPg;12Q2z61azPg-8-rgb_front;12Q2z61azPg_12;12Q2z61azPg_12-8-rgb_front;104.11;109.48;You did get some compression with that rolling pin, but this gives you just a little bit more.;8;18
6628;12Q2z61azPg;12Q2z61azPg-8-rgb_front;12Q2z61azPg_13;12Q2z61azPg_13-8-rgb_front;110.71;120.78;And if you have a few ridges, that's okay because we're probably going to end up wiping those out in the next steps of the process.;8;26
6629;12Q2z61azPg;12Q2z61azPg-8-rgb_front;12Q2z61azPg_14;12Q2z61azPg_14-8-rgb_front;120.78;121.68;So now we have a nice slab of clay.;8;9
6630;12Q2z61azPg;12Q2z61azPg-8-rgb_front;12Q2z61azPg_2;12Q2z61azPg_2-8-rgb_front;23.36;29.54;So in order to make a nice big slab with the rolling pin, I'm going to stretch this out a little bit more.;8;23
6631;12Q2z61azPg;12Q2z61azPg-8-rgb_front;12Q2z61azPg_3;12Q2z61azPg_3-8-rgb_front;29.66;35.86;I probably want to get it to be in the end a little bit more than a quarter of inch thick.;8;21
6632;12Q2z61azPg;12Q2z61azPg-8-rgb_front;12Q2z61azPg_4;12Q2z61azPg_4-8-rgb_front;36.37;45.49;That's a good thickness to be sturdy enough to use and thick, you know thick enough to hold up.;8;19
6633;12Q2z61azPg;12Q2z61azPg-8-rgb_front;12Q2z61azPg_5;12Q2z61azPg_5-8-rgb_front;46.71;48.98;So I've got it a little bit thicker than that right now.;8;12
6634;12Q2z61azPg;12Q2z61azPg-8-rgb_front;12Q2z61azPg_6;12Q2z61azPg_6-8-rgb_front;49.5;63.61;I'm going to take my really big rolling pin here and I'm just going to kind of stretch that out a little bit more and make it nice and smooth.;8;30
6635;12Q2z61azPg;12Q2z61azPg-8-rgb_front;12Q2z61azPg_7;12Q2z61azPg_7-8-rgb_front;67.91;74.11;Having a really wide rolling pin helps because then you're more likely to have the same thickness all the way across.;8;21
6636;12Q2z61azPg;12Q2z61azPg-8-rgb_front;12Q2z61azPg_8;12Q2z61azPg_8-8-rgb_front;74.11;81.14;If you have a really thin rolling pin you're going to have to do it in a couple of different places and you might end up with ridges in the middle.;8;31
6637;12Q2z61azPg;12Q2z61azPg-8-rgb_front;12Q2z61azPg_9;12Q2z61azPg_9-8-rgb_front;81.17;95.88;So once you've got it rolled out to about the thickness that you want you want to take some kind of drywall knife and smooth the surface.;8;27

6646;12Y6ujgJ_2Q;12Y6ujgJ_2Q-8-rgb_front;12Y6ujgJ_2Q_16_17;12Y6ujgJ_2Q_16_17-8-rgb_front;91.08;97.55;Once you get this side down, you want to take the tape off the other side. Take the second piece of tape off that you used for your hinge.;8;29
6647;12Y6ujgJ_2Q;12Y6ujgJ_2Q-8-rgb_front;12Y6ujgJ_2Q_18;12Y6ujgJ_2Q_18-8-rgb_front;99.32;107.86;Now that you have this side, this acts as your hinge.;8;11

6649;12Y6ujgJ_2Q;12Y6ujgJ_2Q-8-rgb_front;12Y6ujgJ_2Q_2;12Y6ujgJ_2Q_2-8-rgb_front;8.75;14.21;First, before you actually apply it, you want to find the center mark of the roof of the are that you're going to mark.;8;24
6650;12Y6ujgJ_2Q;12Y6ujgJ_2Q-8-rgb_front;12Y6ujgJ_2Q_20;12Y6ujgJ_2Q_20-8-rgb_front;121.91;139.81;Once you have it squeegeed, you can simply take your masking slowly peeling it way, keeping it as close to the masking as possible.;8;24
6651;12Y6ujgJ_2Q;12Y6ujgJ_2Q-8-rgb_front;12Y6ujgJ_2Q_21;12Y6ujgJ_2Q_21-8-rgb_front;139.81;153.39;As you see here, I peeled the letter up because of the moisture underneath it.;8;15

6654;12Y6ujgJ_2Q;12Y6ujgJ_2Q-8-rgb_front;12Y6ujgJ_2Q_24;12Y6ujgJ_2Q_24-8-rgb_front;165.99;171.91;Now you have applied using the center hinge wet method application.;8;11

6695;13Omn2P3DcA;13Omn2P3DcA-8-rgb_front;13Omn2P3DcA_3;13Omn2P3DcA_3-8-rgb_front;18.25;27.97;Most people like to wear slippers and with it being Christmas, it's obviously going to be cooler weather so it's actually a nice gift to keep there feet nice and warm.;8;31

6700;13Omn2P3DcA;13Omn2P3DcA-8-rgb_front;13Omn2P3DcA_8;13Omn2P3DcA_8-8-rgb_front;41.23;47.91;So every time that you put your foot in it works very much like the memory foam pillows and mattresses.;8;20

6703;13SBIjnC5qA;13SBIjnC5qA-8-rgb_front;13SBIjnC5qA_1;13SBIjnC5qA_1-8-rgb_front;15.5;27.93;And diagrammatic line is line used to create a configuration, it's the kind of line you use to make a blueprint, it's an informative, an informational line.;8;27
6704;13SBIjnC5qA;13SBIjnC5qA-8-rgb_front;13SBIjnC5qA_10;13SBIjnC5qA_10-8-rgb_front;104.31;108.75;You can get this with a brush or a pencil, you can get this with any medium.;8;17

6706;13SBIjnC5qA;13SBIjnC5qA-8-rgb_front;13SBIjnC5qA_2;13SBIjnC5qA_2-8-rgb_front;28.57;30.91;But you can see here that M.C.;8;7

6709;13SBIjnC5qA;13SBIjnC5qA-8-rgb_front;13SBIjnC5qA_5;13SBIjnC5qA_5-8-rgb_front;40.99;75.82;The whole drawing is created with these lines, and he's managed to give a feeling because he's using all these very straight lines with rulers, he's giving you the sense of a universe that is very controlled and very predictable, at the same time that he's challenging you by making these people go in, staircases that are going down into nowhere and up into nowhere and the whole space is basically undogmatic.;8;72
6710;13SBIjnC5qA;13SBIjnC5qA-8-rgb_front;13SBIjnC5qA_6;13SBIjnC5qA_6-8-rgb_front;76.6;81.39;The other thing that diagrammatic lines can do is they can create different shadows.;8;14

6712;13SBIjnC5qA;13SBIjnC5qA-8-rgb_front;13SBIjnC5qA_8;13SBIjnC5qA_8-8-rgb_front;89.27;95.12;He uses very thin lines where it's very light, he uses very thick lines where it's dark.;8;17
6713;13SBIjnC5qA;13SBIjnC5qA-8-rgb_front;13SBIjnC5qA_9;13SBIjnC5qA_9-8-rgb_front;96.04;104.05;That's compared to, this would be using a calligraphic or gestural line, and you can see, it's much more free-flowing.;8;20

6746;13xhoBKaViM;13xhoBKaViM-8-rgb_front;13xhoBKaViM_1;13xhoBKaViM_1-8-rgb_front;2.58;6.06;Today, we're going to talk about renting photographic equipment.;8;9
6747;13xhoBKaViM;13xhoBKaViM-8-rgb_front;13xhoBKaViM_10;13xhoBKaViM_10-8-rgb_front;58.77;67.25;And usually, the day rate can be anywhere from 20 dollars upwards to 500, maybe even 1,000 dollars for a high-end piece of equipment.;8;24
6748;13xhoBKaViM;13xhoBKaViM-8-rgb_front;13xhoBKaViM_11;13xhoBKaViM_11-8-rgb_front;67.25;74.72;The biggest part about renting something that is really detrimental to it is that you have to put down a deposit.;8;21
6749;13xhoBKaViM;13xhoBKaViM-8-rgb_front;13xhoBKaViM_12;13xhoBKaViM_12-8-rgb_front;74.72;84.85;Now, no camera store owner, in his right mind or her right mind, is going to let you walk out of their camera store with a 5,000 dollar camera without a credit card or a pretty large deposit.;8;38
6750;13xhoBKaViM;13xhoBKaViM-8-rgb_front;13xhoBKaViM_13;13xhoBKaViM_13-8-rgb_front;84.85;91.97;So I know when I first started out, I wanted to make sure that I had that much money on my credit card because they might charge you for that camera.;8;31
6751;13xhoBKaViM;13xhoBKaViM-8-rgb_front;13xhoBKaViM_14;13xhoBKaViM_14-8-rgb_front;91.97;96.67;They might charge a few thousand dollars, and then you'll get that back on your credit card.;8;17
6752;13xhoBKaViM;13xhoBKaViM-8-rgb_front;13xhoBKaViM_15;13xhoBKaViM_15-8-rgb_front;96.67;111.0;Now, if you're working on a budget, this is something that you really have to take seriously because when you leave that camera store, if you had that money on your credit card, you might not have it when you leave, and that is a mistake I've personally made and I've seen some other professionals make.;8;56
6753;13xhoBKaViM;13xhoBKaViM-8-rgb_front;13xhoBKaViM_2;13xhoBKaViM_2-8-rgb_front;7.16;21.14;The one thing about renting equipment that is an excellent opportunity for any photographer, being a professional or an amateur or someone just getting into it, is that you don't have to purchase the equipment you're renting.;8;37
6754;13xhoBKaViM;13xhoBKaViM-8-rgb_front;13xhoBKaViM_3;13xhoBKaViM_3-8-rgb_front;21.61;25.14;We all know that photography equipment is pretty expensive.;8;9

6756;13xhoBKaViM;13xhoBKaViM-8-rgb_front;13xhoBKaViM_5_6;13xhoBKaViM_5_6-8-rgb_front;29.78;36.16;Do you like this camera? And, you know, I give...I try to tip my students off to renting something before they buy it.;8;23

6758;13xhoBKaViM;13xhoBKaViM-8-rgb_front;13xhoBKaViM_8;13xhoBKaViM_8-8-rgb_front;39.92;52.87;When you have to rent a camera for a job -- let's say, you are a professional photographer or someone just starting out in the photography market -- you want to make sure that you call the camera store to make sure they have your piece of equipment.;8;48
6759;13xhoBKaViM;13xhoBKaViM-8-rgb_front;13xhoBKaViM_9;13xhoBKaViM_9-8-rgb_front;52.87;58.77;Most camera stores have a website where they list the equipment they have, and then they list the rate for that equipment.;8;22

6766;13yrKJ6yOPQ;13yrKJ6yOPQ-8-rgb_front;13yrKJ6yOPQ_14;13yrKJ6yOPQ_14-8-rgb_front;54.66;59.82;So if you look at the body as a triangle this way, we're pointing, punching toward the center of the body.;8;21

6768;13yrKJ6yOPQ;13yrKJ6yOPQ-8-rgb_front;13yrKJ6yOPQ_16;13yrKJ6yOPQ_16-8-rgb_front;70.62;71.81;So weight on the inside.;8;5

6862;14Pag7RIAsk;14Pag7RIAsk-8-rgb_front;14Pag7RIAsk_2;14Pag7RIAsk_2-8-rgb_front;7.17;16.24;Make sure your feet are parallel, your knees are slightly bent, your belly button's pulled in towards your spine, your chest is lifted, shoulders are relaxed and down.;8;28

6877;14PatN6qnsQ;14PatN6qnsQ-8-rgb_front;14PatN6qnsQ_7;14PatN6qnsQ_7-8-rgb_front;50.74;56.52;Then we're going to start taking our thumbs and we're going to drill them down into the pot and we're going to go out with it.;8;26
6878;14UHnRRd3GM;14UHnRRd3GM-8-rgb_front;14UHnRRd3GM_0;14UHnRRd3GM_0-8-rgb_front;0.57;6.68;Riding backwards or riding fakie is another very basic step in learning BMX freestyle tricks.;8;15
6879;14UHnRRd3GM;14UHnRRd3GM-8-rgb_front;14UHnRRd3GM_1;14UHnRRd3GM_1-8-rgb_front;7.47;20.13;For me it's one of the things that I enjoy the most about riding although it is very perplexing to a lot of people you know it's just not a very natural motion especially once you spent so many years learning how to ride a bike forward.;8;47
6880;14UHnRRd3GM;14UHnRRd3GM-8-rgb_front;14UHnRRd3GM_2;14UHnRRd3GM_2-8-rgb_front;20.13;27.88;A lot of people just don't understand the whole concept of riding backwards and there is a couple of things you should keep in mind when you are doing that.;8;30
6881;14UHnRRd3GM;14UHnRRd3GM-8-rgb_front;14UHnRRd3GM_3;14UHnRRd3GM_3-8-rgb_front;28.54;46.89;You want to make sure that your weight distribution is center and you also want to make sure that you keep in mind that essentially when you are rolling backwards all of sudden your bike is stirring very differently because rather then stirring from the front and having the front wheel lead in the back wheel around all of sudden you are steering from essentially your back wheel.;8;68
6882;14UHnRRd3GM;14UHnRRd3GM-8-rgb_front;14UHnRRd3GM_4;14UHnRRd3GM_4-8-rgb_front;47.12;60.2;So as you turn you are not only turning basically the opposite of the way that you do when you rolling forward but any sort of motion that come through the front end is going to effect the way that your bike turns much faster.;8;45
6883;14UHnRRd3GM;14UHnRRd3GM-8-rgb_front;14UHnRRd3GM_5;14UHnRRd3GM_5-8-rgb_front;60.93;80.68;For example if you watch and you are rolling if you turn your bike turns very gently where if you are riding backwards you do that and all of sudden your bike is sideways and you have to make sure that you are not making any sudden movements and that you have a nice center weight distribution over the bike.;8;60
6884;14UHnRRd3GM;14UHnRRd3GM-8-rgb_front;14UHnRRd3GM_6;14UHnRRd3GM_6-8-rgb_front;81.41;89.62;Basically riding fakie is one of the most necessary tricks or I guess types of maneuvers that you can learn how to BMX bike.;8;24
6885;14UHnRRd3GM;14UHnRRd3GM-8-rgb_front;14UHnRRd3GM_7;14UHnRRd3GM_7-8-rgb_front;89.72;95.18;Once you have fakie skills mastered it opens up a whole new roam of tricks that you can start experimenting with.;8;21
6886;14UHnRRd3GM;14UHnRRd3GM-8-rgb_front;14UHnRRd3GM_8;14UHnRRd3GM_8-8-rgb_front;96.56;98.22;Here I will show you how it works right no.;8;10

6888;14ZYG0hU6G8;14ZYG0hU6G8-8-rgb_front;14ZYG0hU6G8_1;14ZYG0hU6G8_1-8-rgb_front;9.57;15.12;You want to use a deep clarifying shampoo and make sure it says clarifying shampoo.;8;15
6889;14ZYG0hU6G8;14ZYG0hU6G8-8-rgb_front;14ZYG0hU6G8_10;14ZYG0hU6G8_10-8-rgb_front;54.93;58.56;So she's not going to have extra light spots extra dark spots.;8;12
6890;14ZYG0hU6G8;14ZYG0hU6G8-8-rgb_front;14ZYG0hU6G8_11;14ZYG0hU6G8_11-8-rgb_front;59.05;65.39;It's evened the porosity of her hair and will make her hair ready for hair color.;8;16
6891;14ZYG0hU6G8;14ZYG0hU6G8-8-rgb_front;14ZYG0hU6G8_12;14ZYG0hU6G8_12-8-rgb_front;66.03;68.68;So Tiffany will have beautiful highlights when we're done.;8;9
6892;14ZYG0hU6G8;14ZYG0hU6G8-8-rgb_front;14ZYG0hU6G8_2;14ZYG0hU6G8_2-8-rgb_front;17.03;20.3;That gets rid of any residue that might be in the hair.;8;12
6893;14ZYG0hU6G8;14ZYG0hU6G8-8-rgb_front;14ZYG0hU6G8_3;14ZYG0hU6G8_3-8-rgb_front;20.33;24.87;Any styling products, any hairspray buildup and sometimes there's a conditioner buildup.;8;12
6894;14ZYG0hU6G8;14ZYG0hU6G8-8-rgb_front;14ZYG0hU6G8_4;14ZYG0hU6G8_4-8-rgb_front;25.34;30.41;That will keep your hair from coloring properly if you do not use a clarifying shampoo to get rid of that.;8;21
6895;14ZYG0hU6G8;14ZYG0hU6G8-8-rgb_front;14ZYG0hU6G8_5;14ZYG0hU6G8_5-8-rgb_front;31.63;38.94;Then the next process that I did was a deep conditioner, a protein anything any conditioner that says protein on it.;8;21
6896;14ZYG0hU6G8;14ZYG0hU6G8-8-rgb_front;14ZYG0hU6G8_6;14ZYG0hU6G8_6-8-rgb_front;38.97;40.77;You want to use a protein based conditioner.;8;8
6897;14ZYG0hU6G8;14ZYG0hU6G8-8-rgb_front;14ZYG0hU6G8_7;14ZYG0hU6G8_7-8-rgb_front;41.13;46.63;Which is a very thick conditioner that will help fill in any dry areas of her hair.;8;17
6898;14ZYG0hU6G8;14ZYG0hU6G8-8-rgb_front;14ZYG0hU6G8_8;14ZYG0hU6G8_8-8-rgb_front;46.63;48.48;So her hair color processes properly.;8;6
6899;14ZYG0hU6G8;14ZYG0hU6G8-8-rgb_front;14ZYG0hU6G8_9;14ZYG0hU6G8_9-8-rgb_front;49.18;54.69;So I've pre-treated her hair for hair color so we can get the best results from her highlights.;8;18
6900;14_GpqYx36s;14_GpqYx36s-8-rgb_front;14_GpqYx36s_0;14_GpqYx36s_0-8-rgb_front;0.24;8.67;And then after you've prepared your tape grid the next step you want to do is add some greenery to cover up your mechanics and add prepare a foundation for your arrangement.;8;32
6901;14_GpqYx36s;14_GpqYx36s-8-rgb_front;14_GpqYx36s_1;14_GpqYx36s_1-8-rgb_front;9.16;14.46;So you want to cut the greenery and tuck it in between the grid holes like this.;8;17
6902;14_GpqYx36s;14_GpqYx36s-8-rgb_front;14_GpqYx36s_10;14_GpqYx36s_10-8-rgb_front;39.82;43.2;Again, cutting your stems before you put them down into the water.;8;12
6903;14_GpqYx36s;14_GpqYx36s-8-rgb_front;14_GpqYx36s_11;14_GpqYx36s_11-8-rgb_front;44.36;46.56;Cut the stems, place it in.;8;6
6904;14_GpqYx36s;14_GpqYx36s-8-rgb_front;14_GpqYx36s_12;14_GpqYx36s_12-8-rgb_front;47.35;52.48;And you just want to create, your hydrangeas are going to be up here so you just want to create a good foundation.;8;23
6905;14_GpqYx36s;14_GpqYx36s-8-rgb_front;14_GpqYx36s_13;14_GpqYx36s_13-8-rgb_front;52.98;57.05;And that'll hold them securely in the bowl between the grid and your greenery.;8;14
6906;14_GpqYx36s;14_GpqYx36s-8-rgb_front;14_GpqYx36s_14;14_GpqYx36s_14-8-rgb_front;59.13;66.63;So we're just going to put a few more pieces in like this and we're going to go around in a circular fashion like that.;8;25
6907;14_GpqYx36s;14_GpqYx36s-8-rgb_front;14_GpqYx36s_15;14_GpqYx36s_15-8-rgb_front;69.6;73.11;And tuck it in tightly and securely.;8;7
6908;14_GpqYx36s;14_GpqYx36s-8-rgb_front;14_GpqYx36s_16;14_GpqYx36s_16-8-rgb_front;74.8;76.7;And this is how we prepare the greenery.;8;8
6909;14_GpqYx36s;14_GpqYx36s-8-rgb_front;14_GpqYx36s_17;14_GpqYx36s_17-8-rgb_front;77.44;78.13;Put it in.;8;3

6911;14_GpqYx36s;14_GpqYx36s-8-rgb_front;14_GpqYx36s_19;14_GpqYx36s_19-8-rgb_front;82.16;82.93;Just like that.;8;3
6912;14_GpqYx36s;14_GpqYx36s-8-rgb_front;14_GpqYx36s_2;14_GpqYx36s_2-8-rgb_front;15.05;16.69;And you can add, this is leather leaf.;8;8
6913;14_GpqYx36s;14_GpqYx36s-8-rgb_front;14_GpqYx36s_20;14_GpqYx36s_20-8-rgb_front;82.93;85.04;That's how you green your vase for the hydrangeas.;8;9
6914;14_GpqYx36s;14_GpqYx36s-8-rgb_front;14_GpqYx36s_3;14_GpqYx36s_3-8-rgb_front;18.12;19.43;Just tick it in like that.;8;6
6915;14_GpqYx36s;14_GpqYx36s-8-rgb_front;14_GpqYx36s_4;14_GpqYx36s_4-8-rgb_front;19.56;21.39;Make sure it's getting down into the water.;8;8
6916;14_GpqYx36s;14_GpqYx36s-8-rgb_front;14_GpqYx36s_5;14_GpqYx36s_5-8-rgb_front;21.39;26.17;And you're going to put a couple of pieces, it doesn't have to be completely full.;8;16
6917;14_GpqYx36s;14_GpqYx36s-8-rgb_front;14_GpqYx36s_6;14_GpqYx36s_6-8-rgb_front;28.5;30.13;And this is how you edge your greenery.;8;8
6918;14_GpqYx36s;14_GpqYx36s-8-rgb_front;14_GpqYx36s_7;14_GpqYx36s_7-8-rgb_front;30.78;31.66;Just like that.;8;3
6919;14_GpqYx36s;14_GpqYx36s-8-rgb_front;14_GpqYx36s_8;14_GpqYx36s_8-8-rgb_front;32.23;35.01;And then we'll take, this is lemon leaves.;8;8
6920;14_GpqYx36s;14_GpqYx36s-8-rgb_front;14_GpqYx36s_9;14_GpqYx36s_9-8-rgb_front;36.27;39.26;It'll add a different texture and a fullness.;8;8
6921;14fTPEpnW6s;14fTPEpnW6s-8-rgb_front;14fTPEpnW6s_0;14fTPEpnW6s_0-8-rgb_front;0.82;4.64;Okay, as you can see, I'm totally out of position for pose fifteen.;8;13
6922;14fTPEpnW6s;14fTPEpnW6s-8-rgb_front;14fTPEpnW6s_1;14fTPEpnW6s_1-8-rgb_front;4.85;10.54;So I'm going to take you back to thirteen and get you back into the pose so we can add a hand to this.;8;24
6923;14fTPEpnW6s;14fTPEpnW6s-8-rgb_front;14fTPEpnW6s_10;14fTPEpnW6s_10-8-rgb_front;48.64;58.84;Pants are really fun to model because the longer the leg and, most print models have nice long legs, you really get to show off the pant leg.;8;28
6924;14fTPEpnW6s;14fTPEpnW6s-8-rgb_front;14fTPEpnW6s_11;14fTPEpnW6s_11-8-rgb_front;59.11;63.43;We want to show the flare, if it's narrow at the bottom or flared at the bottom.;8;17
6925;14fTPEpnW6s;14fTPEpnW6s-8-rgb_front;14fTPEpnW6s_12;14fTPEpnW6s_12-8-rgb_front;63.66;66.36;We also want to show any designs that are on the pant.;8;12
6926;14fTPEpnW6s;14fTPEpnW6s-8-rgb_front;14fTPEpnW6s_13;14fTPEpnW6s_13-8-rgb_front;66.9;75.6;So in pose fifteen, you can show the sleeves and the pants particularly well with a very broad pose.;8;19
6927;14fTPEpnW6s;14fTPEpnW6s-8-rgb_front;14fTPEpnW6s_2;14fTPEpnW6s_2-8-rgb_front;11.16;19.21;I'm going to point my left toe straight ahead with a straight leg and get my right leg positioned in a ninety degree angle.;8;24
6928;14fTPEpnW6s;14fTPEpnW6s-8-rgb_front;14fTPEpnW6s_3;14fTPEpnW6s_3-8-rgb_front;19.55;26.46;The right heel is just to the back of the right, the left heel so that it creates this ninety degree angle.;8;22
6929;14fTPEpnW6s;14fTPEpnW6s-8-rgb_front;14fTPEpnW6s_4;14fTPEpnW6s_4-8-rgb_front;26.75;29.09;The right toe is pointed straight out to the side.;8;10
6930;14fTPEpnW6s;14fTPEpnW6s-8-rgb_front;14fTPEpnW6s_5;14fTPEpnW6s_5-8-rgb_front;29.73;31.65;In pose fourteen, we added one hand.;8;7
6931;14fTPEpnW6s;14fTPEpnW6s-8-rgb_front;14fTPEpnW6s_6;14fTPEpnW6s_6-8-rgb_front;31.65;34.16;In pose fifteen, we're going to add two hands.;8;9
6932;14fTPEpnW6s;14fTPEpnW6s-8-rgb_front;14fTPEpnW6s_7;14fTPEpnW6s_7-8-rgb_front;34.6;36.57;So bring both hands up to the hip.;8;8
6933;14fTPEpnW6s;14fTPEpnW6s-8-rgb_front;14fTPEpnW6s_8;14fTPEpnW6s_8-8-rgb_front;37.01;43.93;Again, keep your focus into camera and notice that the body is totally broad to narrow by adding two elbows up.;8;21
6934;14fTPEpnW6s;14fTPEpnW6s-8-rgb_front;14fTPEpnW6s_9;14fTPEpnW6s_9-8-rgb_front;44.16;48.64;And I have a wide view of the clothing that I'm wearing, particularly pants.;8;14
6935;14fs-ot5KCc;14fs-ot5KCc-8-rgb_front;14fs-ot5KCc_1;14fs-ot5KCc_1-8-rgb_front;9.11;15.36;After you've mastered your round-off, you're able to start moving on into more advanced tumbling.;8;15
6936;14fs-ot5KCc;14fs-ot5KCc-8-rgb_front;14fs-ot5KCc_10;14fs-ot5KCc_10-8-rgb_front;62.17;69.17;So it's really important, your spotters are going to be behind you, we're going to end up going completely back and landing on the palms of our hands.;8;28
6937;14fs-ot5KCc;14fs-ot5KCc-8-rgb_front;14fs-ot5KCc_11;14fs-ot5KCc_11-8-rgb_front;69.55;78.31;Make sure you can keep your arms straight and you want to do a little shrug at the shoulder and then you're going to pop out of it, similarly to how you would pop out of a handstand.;8;38
6938;14fs-ot5KCc;14fs-ot5KCc-8-rgb_front;14fs-ot5KCc_12;14fs-ot5KCc_12-8-rgb_front;78.95;85.94;Now it's also important to learn, once you've mastered your back handspring, the second high level skill is going to be your tuck.;8;23
6939;14fs-ot5KCc;14fs-ot5KCc-8-rgb_front;14fs-ot5KCc_13;14fs-ot5KCc_13-8-rgb_front;86.37;94.37;Now first you need to master your tuck jump, which is going to be this position here, knees high up on the chest.;8;23
6940;14fs-ot5KCc;14fs-ot5KCc-8-rgb_front;14fs-ot5KCc_14;14fs-ot5KCc_14-8-rgb_front;94.85;101.84;And a tuck jump is basically going to be this form with both your knees hugged tightly to your chest in the air.;8;23
6941;14fs-ot5KCc;14fs-ot5KCc-8-rgb_front;14fs-ot5KCc_15;14fs-ot5KCc_15-8-rgb_front;102.16;111.97;You can do a running tuck which is going to be attached to your round-off, or your handspring, or you can do a standing still tuck, which is going to be a different prep from our handspring.;8;37
6942;14fs-ot5KCc;14fs-ot5KCc-8-rgb_front;14fs-ot5KCc_16;14fs-ot5KCc_16-8-rgb_front;112.45;114.07;We're going to start stationary.;8;5
6943;14fs-ot5KCc;14fs-ot5KCc-8-rgb_front;14fs-ot5KCc_17;14fs-ot5KCc_17-8-rgb_front;114.07;118.42;We're going to get up on our toes to get some momentum, and we're going to go straight in.;8;19
6944;14fs-ot5KCc;14fs-ot5KCc-8-rgb_front;14fs-ot5KCc_18;14fs-ot5KCc_18-8-rgb_front;118.65;121.66;It's really important to ride your jump up when you're doing a tuck.;8;13
6945;14fs-ot5KCc;14fs-ot5KCc-8-rgb_front;14fs-ot5KCc_19;14fs-ot5KCc_19-8-rgb_front;121.73;126.61;You really need to pull yourself all the way to the tippy top before you go into the tuck position.;8;20
6946;14fs-ot5KCc;14fs-ot5KCc-8-rgb_front;14fs-ot5KCc_2;14fs-ot5KCc_2-8-rgb_front;15.68;22.89;Now advanced tumbling is most easily done in combination from a round-off because you're going to get a lot of momentum.;8;21
6947;14fs-ot5KCc;14fs-ot5KCc-8-rgb_front;14fs-ot5KCc_20;14fs-ot5KCc_20-8-rgb_front;126.61;130.46;You want to hold that position tightly until you spin all the way around.;8;14
6948;14fs-ot5KCc;14fs-ot5KCc-8-rgb_front;14fs-ot5KCc_21;14fs-ot5KCc_21-8-rgb_front;130.84;136.7;Now a lot of us, when we're landing our tucks, you're going to be in this position down here on the floor a lot when you land your tucks.;8;29
6949;14fs-ot5KCc;14fs-ot5KCc-8-rgb_front;14fs-ot5KCc_22;14fs-ot5KCc_22-8-rgb_front;136.97;142.95;That's ok, you're still learning, just get up out of if, and get a spot until you can make that full rotation.;8;22
6950;14fs-ot5KCc;14fs-ot5KCc-8-rgb_front;14fs-ot5KCc_23;14fs-ot5KCc_23-8-rgb_front;143.46;146.32;Another tumble which is really advanced is called a layout.;8;10
6951;14fs-ot5KCc;14fs-ot5KCc-8-rgb_front;14fs-ot5KCc_24;14fs-ot5KCc_24-8-rgb_front;146.32;151.57;A layout's going to be a flip that's similar to a tuck where your hands never make contact to the ground.;8;21
6952;14fs-ot5KCc;14fs-ot5KCc-8-rgb_front;14fs-ot5KCc_25;14fs-ot5KCc_25-8-rgb_front;152.08;155.99;In the air your layout position is basically going to be this.;8;12

6957;14fs-ot5KCc;14fs-ot5KCc-8-rgb_front;14fs-ot5KCc_3;14fs-ot5KCc_3-8-rgb_front;23.65;27.48;Demonstrated right here are the steps that you're going to take in a back handspring.;8;15
6958;14fs-ot5KCc;14fs-ot5KCc-8-rgb_front;14fs-ot5KCc_30;14fs-ot5KCc_30-8-rgb_front;174.3;177.43;A good way to master those is using trampolines.;8;9
6959;14fs-ot5KCc;14fs-ot5KCc-8-rgb_front;14fs-ot5KCc_31;14fs-ot5KCc_31-8-rgb_front;177.79;182.02;You can use foam pits and also definitely use lots of mats.;8;12
6960;14fs-ot5KCc;14fs-ot5KCc-8-rgb_front;14fs-ot5KCc_4;14fs-ot5KCc_4-8-rgb_front;27.89;30.25;I highly recommend starting out with spotters.;8;7
6961;14fs-ot5KCc;14fs-ot5KCc-8-rgb_front;14fs-ot5KCc_5;14fs-ot5KCc_5-8-rgb_front;30.25;35.74;This is going to be the best way to learn the movements in slow motion, then you can go ahead and take it from there.;8;25
6962;14fs-ot5KCc;14fs-ot5KCc-8-rgb_front;14fs-ot5KCc_6;14fs-ot5KCc_6-8-rgb_front;36.43;43.88;Now we can also do all of these tumbles which we're going to call standing format instead of running which is linked onto the round-off.;8;25
6963;14fs-ot5KCc;14fs-ot5KCc-8-rgb_front;14fs-ot5KCc_7;14fs-ot5KCc_7-8-rgb_front;44.26;49.99;Now it's important when you're learning your back handspring to have tons of matted floors.;8;15
6964;14fs-ot5KCc;14fs-ot5KCc-8-rgb_front;14fs-ot5KCc_8;14fs-ot5KCc_8-8-rgb_front;50.08;53.36;These are going to be provided by your facility when you're tumbling.;8;12
6965;14fs-ot5KCc;14fs-ot5KCc-8-rgb_front;14fs-ot5KCc_9;14fs-ot5KCc_9-8-rgb_front;53.8;61.88;Now the correct position to start off with a back hand spring, you're going to want to bend at the knees and rock back on your heels as you take off.;8;31
6966;14hq4hRjwLc;14hq4hRjwLc-8-rgb_front;14hq4hRjwLc_0;14hq4hRjwLc_0-8-rgb_front;0.58;4.81;Hi, I'm Tim Gipson and I'm going to talk to you about how to measure windows.;8;16
6967;14hq4hRjwLc;14hq4hRjwLc-8-rgb_front;14hq4hRjwLc_1;14hq4hRjwLc_1-8-rgb_front;5.34;10.42;Now, window size is based on the finished opening that we have around the windows.;8;15
6968;14hq4hRjwLc;14hq4hRjwLc-8-rgb_front;14hq4hRjwLc_10;14hq4hRjwLc_10-8-rgb_front;69.16;74.87;So, from the top finished opening of the window to the sill gives me my height of the window.;8;19
6969;14hq4hRjwLc;14hq4hRjwLc-8-rgb_front;14hq4hRjwLc_11;14hq4hRjwLc_11-8-rgb_front;75.51;82.71;So, in this case as I've measured I've got a thirty one by seventy inch window.;8;16
6970;14hq4hRjwLc;14hq4hRjwLc-8-rgb_front;14hq4hRjwLc_12;14hq4hRjwLc_12-8-rgb_front;83.48;87.14;And how that's useful is draw a rectangle.;8;8
6971;14hq4hRjwLc;14hq4hRjwLc-8-rgb_front;14hq4hRjwLc_13;14hq4hRjwLc_13-8-rgb_front;87.14;88.36;Put those dimensions down.;8;4
6972;14hq4hRjwLc;14hq4hRjwLc-8-rgb_front;14hq4hRjwLc_14;14hq4hRjwLc_14-8-rgb_front;88.71;102.65;So, now if you're constructing a valance or you're putting curtains up or measuring for curtains, then you have your good measurements for you windows as far as how many panels you'll need or what size you'll need for blinds.;8;40
6973;14hq4hRjwLc;14hq4hRjwLc-8-rgb_front;14hq4hRjwLc_15;14hq4hRjwLc_15-8-rgb_front;103.18;105.09;I'm Tim Gipson and that's how to measure a window.;8;10
6974;14hq4hRjwLc;14hq4hRjwLc-8-rgb_front;14hq4hRjwLc_2;14hq4hRjwLc_2-8-rgb_front;10.76;19.42;So, in this case these windows have finished drywall and so the width would be from one finished side to the other.;8;22
6975;14hq4hRjwLc;14hq4hRjwLc-8-rgb_front;14hq4hRjwLc_3;14hq4hRjwLc_3-8-rgb_front;20.05;28.95;So, to measure that, simply put my tape measure flush to one side and measure over to the other side and I get thirty one inches.;8;26
6976;14hq4hRjwLc;14hq4hRjwLc-8-rgb_front;14hq4hRjwLc_4;14hq4hRjwLc_4-8-rgb_front;30.08;33.82;So, just by measuring flush side to flush side I get thirty one inches.;8;14
6977;14hq4hRjwLc;14hq4hRjwLc-8-rgb_front;14hq4hRjwLc_5;14hq4hRjwLc_5-8-rgb_front;33.82;36.1;So, my window is thirty one inches high.;8;8
6978;14hq4hRjwLc;14hq4hRjwLc-8-rgb_front;14hq4hRjwLc_6;14hq4hRjwLc_6-8-rgb_front;36.74;38.76;Now, the same thing on the height of the window.;8;10
6979;14hq4hRjwLc;14hq4hRjwLc-8-rgb_front;14hq4hRjwLc_7;14hq4hRjwLc_7-8-rgb_front;38.76;49.09;Now, the height we can't see because it's up inside this valance, but there will be a top finished surface just like this drywall finish up inside.;8;27
6980;14hq4hRjwLc;14hq4hRjwLc-8-rgb_front;14hq4hRjwLc_8;14hq4hRjwLc_8-8-rgb_front;50.77;65.96;So, I can insert my tape measure up to that width and then I what I want to do is I want to measure down to the sill down at the bottom.;8;32
6981;14hq4hRjwLc;14hq4hRjwLc-8-rgb_front;14hq4hRjwLc_9;14hq4hRjwLc_9-8-rgb_front;66.37;68.56;In this case I get seventy inches.;8;7

6983;14i542dF6Ps;14i542dF6Ps-8-rgb_front;14i542dF6Ps_1;14i542dF6Ps_1-8-rgb_front;7.32;13.23;When you are working with someone and you want to give them a massage what you want to do is oil their back up first and I have already done that.;8;31
6984;14i542dF6Ps;14i542dF6Ps-8-rgb_front;14i542dF6Ps_2;14i542dF6Ps_2-8-rgb_front;14.31;15.52;We don't really need to add a whole lot.;8;9
6985;14i542dF6Ps;14i542dF6Ps-8-rgb_front;14i542dF6Ps_3;14i542dF6Ps_3-8-rgb_front;15.52;33.45;You don't want to put so much oil on someone when you are giving a massage that they're like sliding around in oil and grease so just enough to give you some nice glide is all you need and then just do some nice soothing strokes, choppy short strokes are not always the most comfortable or feel the best.;8;59
6986;14i542dF6Ps;14i542dF6Ps-8-rgb_front;14i542dF6Ps_4;14i542dF6Ps_4-8-rgb_front;33.99;57.42;You want to do long gliding strokes to make the person feel connected and then some nice other massage strokes that feel good are those that go against the muscle fiber called cross fiber friction and since most of the muscles in the back run this way what you would like to do is go across and the opposite way and that really feels good and helps loosen up the muscle fibers and release tension and stress in the person.;8;80
6987;14i542dF6Ps;14i542dF6Ps-8-rgb_front;14i542dF6Ps_5;14i542dF6Ps_5-8-rgb_front;57.42;75.58;You can work in the shoulder area through here, around the shoulder blades and come up through the neck and you can do this on any part of the body, this long stroking and soothing strokes down on the arms and also when you get to the leg area you can do that too.;8;54
6988;14i542dF6Ps;14i542dF6Ps-8-rgb_front;14i542dF6Ps_6;14i542dF6Ps_6-8-rgb_front;76.82;80.11;The main thing you want to be careful of is not to rub on the bone.;8;16
6989;14i542dF6Ps;14i542dF6Ps-8-rgb_front;14i542dF6Ps_7;14i542dF6Ps_7-8-rgb_front;80.11;102.1;You want to avoid the bony prominences on the body, work on the muscle tissues and ask for feedback from the person you are working on so that way if you are new to this and you are just playing around with a friend and just trying to give a massage and not professionally trained, have them give you feedback on how you are doing and if you are rubbing on anything that is painful.;8;75
6990;14i542dF6Ps;14i542dF6Ps-8-rgb_front;14i542dF6Ps_8;14i542dF6Ps_8-8-rgb_front;102.1;103.33;You want to be careful about that.;8;7
6991;14i542dF6Ps;14i542dF6Ps-8-rgb_front;14i542dF6Ps_9;14i542dF6Ps_9-8-rgb_front;104.56;111.79;Just go nice and slow and stroke through the areas that need it and that's how you give a massage.;8;20
6992;14klV5a4_Rg;14klV5a4_Rg-8-rgb_front;14klV5a4_Rg_0;14klV5a4_Rg_0-8-rgb_front;0.54;7.25;Now, I've taken all four of my side walls and I've flipped them onto their backside so that the leaves are facing the bottom here.;8;25
6993;14klV5a4_Rg;14klV5a4_Rg-8-rgb_front;14klV5a4_Rg_1;14klV5a4_Rg_1-8-rgb_front;7.69;11.88;And, they're all facing the same direction where the slits are all at the same side.;8;16
6994;14klV5a4_Rg;14klV5a4_Rg-8-rgb_front;14klV5a4_Rg_10;14klV5a4_Rg_10-8-rgb_front;46.54;53.58;So, then you do it on the top edge and then also on the side edge of the same piece.;8;20
6995;14klV5a4_Rg;14klV5a4_Rg-8-rgb_front;14klV5a4_Rg_11;14klV5a4_Rg_11-8-rgb_front;57.82;61.66;Get them really well scored and slipped.;8;7
6996;14klV5a4_Rg;14klV5a4_Rg-8-rgb_front;14klV5a4_Rg_12;14klV5a4_Rg_12-8-rgb_front;64.22;67.7;The gooier they are the better they're going to stick together.;8;11
6997;14klV5a4_Rg;14klV5a4_Rg-8-rgb_front;14klV5a4_Rg_13;14klV5a4_Rg_13-8-rgb_front;68.22;75.46;So, you're going to need to do that to all four pieces before you move on to putting it together.;8;20
6998;14klV5a4_Rg;14klV5a4_Rg-8-rgb_front;14klV5a4_Rg_2;14klV5a4_Rg_2-8-rgb_front;12.58;17.22;So, now I'm going to moisten the top edge of one piece.;8;12
6999;14klV5a4_Rg;14klV5a4_Rg-8-rgb_front;14klV5a4_Rg_3;14klV5a4_Rg_3-8-rgb_front;17.5;20.05;And, taking my scoring tool which has multiple needles.;8;9
7000;14klV5a4_Rg;14klV5a4_Rg-8-rgb_front;14klV5a4_Rg_4;14klV5a4_Rg_4-8-rgb_front;20.31;23.53;You can use a regular needle tool, you're just going to have to do a lot more scratching.;8;18
7001;14klV5a4_Rg;14klV5a4_Rg-8-rgb_front;14klV5a4_Rg_5;14klV5a4_Rg_5-8-rgb_front;23.53;25.51;So, it's really nice to have one of these.;8;9
7002;14klV5a4_Rg;14klV5a4_Rg-8-rgb_front;14klV5a4_Rg_6;14klV5a4_Rg_6-8-rgb_front;26.54;33.09;Make some cuts and them take your slip again and just put a little layer of that on there.;8;19
7003;14klV5a4_Rg;14klV5a4_Rg-8-rgb_front;14klV5a4_Rg_7;14klV5a4_Rg_7-8-rgb_front;33.63;35.27;It's going to act a little bit as a glue.;8;10
7004;14klV5a4_Rg;14klV5a4_Rg-8-rgb_front;14klV5a4_Rg_8;14klV5a4_Rg_8-8-rgb_front;35.27;39.86;It's going to help bond these pieces together, because they are leather hard.;8;13
7005;14klV5a4_Rg;14klV5a4_Rg-8-rgb_front;14klV5a4_Rg_9;14klV5a4_Rg_9-8-rgb_front;40.66;45.94;So, they do need a little bit of extra moisture and that'll do that.;8;14
7006;14vF1lPQCgc;14vF1lPQCgc-8-rgb_front;14vF1lPQCgc_0;14vF1lPQCgc_0-8-rgb_front;0.13;2.4;Okay, now we are going to add some scallops.;8;9
7007;14vF1lPQCgc;14vF1lPQCgc-8-rgb_front;14vF1lPQCgc_1;14vF1lPQCgc_1-8-rgb_front;2.4;5.71;We are going to come back about halfway.;8;8
7008;14vF1lPQCgc;14vF1lPQCgc-8-rgb_front;14vF1lPQCgc_10;14vF1lPQCgc_10-8-rgb_front;63.55;66.67;Okay, and then just pull it off of the pre-strung beads.;8;11
7009;14vF1lPQCgc;14vF1lPQCgc-8-rgb_front;14vF1lPQCgc_11;14vF1lPQCgc_11-8-rgb_front;69.27;74.59;Okay, and now we will come to our next marked off point.;8;12
7010;14vF1lPQCgc;14vF1lPQCgc-8-rgb_front;14vF1lPQCgc_12;14vF1lPQCgc_12-8-rgb_front;79.61;83.86;Okay, you want to go in and out like this.;8;10
7011;14vF1lPQCgc;14vF1lPQCgc-8-rgb_front;14vF1lPQCgc_13;14vF1lPQCgc_13-8-rgb_front;86.35;92.37;Okay, and now you have got a little crisscrossed swag going on.;8;12
7012;14vF1lPQCgc;14vF1lPQCgc-8-rgb_front;14vF1lPQCgc_14;14vF1lPQCgc_14-8-rgb_front;92.37;93.16;It is very pretty.;8;4
7013;14vF1lPQCgc;14vF1lPQCgc-8-rgb_front;14vF1lPQCgc_15;14vF1lPQCgc_15-8-rgb_front;94.42;96.92;Okay, and we will do one more.;8;7
7014;14vF1lPQCgc;14vF1lPQCgc-8-rgb_front;14vF1lPQCgc_16;14vF1lPQCgc_16-8-rgb_front;96.92;105.62;I am going to secure this pre-strung beads here and measure it off.;8;13
7015;14vF1lPQCgc;14vF1lPQCgc-8-rgb_front;14vF1lPQCgc_17;14vF1lPQCgc_17-8-rgb_front;105.62;109.1;It has got just the right amount of beads on it.;8;11
7016;14vF1lPQCgc;14vF1lPQCgc-8-rgb_front;14vF1lPQCgc_18;14vF1lPQCgc_18-8-rgb_front;109.1;116.16;And, slide your needle very slowly and you kind of watch the beads as the needle goes through.;8;18
7017;14vF1lPQCgc;14vF1lPQCgc-8-rgb_front;14vF1lPQCgc_19;14vF1lPQCgc_19-8-rgb_front;116.16;119.65;You can see it enter each of the beads.;8;9
7018;14vF1lPQCgc;14vF1lPQCgc-8-rgb_front;14vF1lPQCgc_2;14vF1lPQCgc_2-8-rgb_front;5.78;17.19;You can mark the halfway point between each of the scallops that you have with some pins.;8;17
7019;14vF1lPQCgc;14vF1lPQCgc-8-rgb_front;14vF1lPQCgc_20;14vF1lPQCgc_20-8-rgb_front;119.65;127.85;If you see the needle come out at the side, then you want to pull back and redo it.;8;19
7020;14vF1lPQCgc;14vF1lPQCgc-8-rgb_front;14vF1lPQCgc_21;14vF1lPQCgc_21-8-rgb_front;129.67;141.93;Let me cut the knot off of the pre-strung beads and pull that up and go to our next marked off section.;8;22
7021;14vF1lPQCgc;14vF1lPQCgc-8-rgb_front;14vF1lPQCgc_22;14vF1lPQCgc_22-8-rgb_front;141.93;151.73;And, you will just continue that to the end and we will secure each scallop as we go.;8;18
7022;14vF1lPQCgc;14vF1lPQCgc-8-rgb_front;14vF1lPQCgc_23;14vF1lPQCgc_23-8-rgb_front;153.42;160.27;Okay, now when you get to the point where your thread is about twice the length of your needle you want to stop.;8;23
7023;14vF1lPQCgc;14vF1lPQCgc-8-rgb_front;14vF1lPQCgc_24;14vF1lPQCgc_24-8-rgb_front;160.62;168.34;Do not be tempted to continue to bead till you are too close to the needle, because you need room to make your knot.;8;24
7024;14vF1lPQCgc;14vF1lPQCgc-8-rgb_front;14vF1lPQCgc_25;14vF1lPQCgc_25-8-rgb_front;168.76;172.22;So, to make the knot we want to just come up through the fabric a little bit.;8;17
7025;14vF1lPQCgc;14vF1lPQCgc-8-rgb_front;14vF1lPQCgc_26;14vF1lPQCgc_26-8-rgb_front;172.22;173.83;Grab a little bit of fabric.;8;6
7026;14vF1lPQCgc;14vF1lPQCgc-8-rgb_front;14vF1lPQCgc_27;14vF1lPQCgc_27-8-rgb_front;174.16;175.05;You make a loop.;8;4
7027;14vF1lPQCgc;14vF1lPQCgc-8-rgb_front;14vF1lPQCgc_28;14vF1lPQCgc_28-8-rgb_front;175.81;182.1;You put your needle through the loop and hold the next loop while you pull down the first loop.;8;19
7028;14vF1lPQCgc;14vF1lPQCgc-8-rgb_front;14vF1lPQCgc_29;14vF1lPQCgc_29-8-rgb_front;182.99;189.88;And then, put your needle again through the loop and pull that down and pull the whole thing taut.;8;19
7029;14vF1lPQCgc;14vF1lPQCgc-8-rgb_front;14vF1lPQCgc_3;14vF1lPQCgc_3-8-rgb_front;19.3;20.95;And then, we are going to come back.;8;8
7030;14vF1lPQCgc;14vF1lPQCgc-8-rgb_front;14vF1lPQCgc_30;14vF1lPQCgc_30-8-rgb_front;190.35;192.3;That should make a good secure knot.;8;7
7031;14vF1lPQCgc;14vF1lPQCgc-8-rgb_front;14vF1lPQCgc_31;14vF1lPQCgc_31-8-rgb_front;192.3;195.63;And, you can cut off close to the knot.;8;9
7032;14vF1lPQCgc;14vF1lPQCgc-8-rgb_front;14vF1lPQCgc_4;14vF1lPQCgc_4-8-rgb_front;20.95;29.86;So, you just slide your needle through along the seam and come out at your marked point.;8;17

7141;15XTbrrGLDY;15XTbrrGLDY-8-rgb_front;15XTbrrGLDY_10;15XTbrrGLDY_10-8-rgb_front;48.6;52.17;We're first going to start with a cleansing treatment.;8;9
7142;15XTbrrGLDY;15XTbrrGLDY-8-rgb_front;15XTbrrGLDY_11;15XTbrrGLDY_11-8-rgb_front;52.17;67.54;We're going to do two cleansing treatments, and a deep exfoliation, and then we are going to start again into the process of the softening gel, enzyme, and we're going to steam and open up those pores for a cleaning.;8;40
7143;15XTbrrGLDY;15XTbrrGLDY-8-rgb_front;15XTbrrGLDY_12;15XTbrrGLDY_12-8-rgb_front;67.57;68.69;Alright, take a nice, deep breath.;8;6
7144;15XTbrrGLDY;15XTbrrGLDY-8-rgb_front;15XTbrrGLDY_13;15XTbrrGLDY_13-8-rgb_front;69.32;74.82;Our steam's just about ready and we'll be turning that off.;8;11
7145;15XTbrrGLDY;15XTbrrGLDY-8-rgb_front;15XTbrrGLDY_14;15XTbrrGLDY_14-8-rgb_front;74.82;77.13;And there it is, ready to go.;8;7
7146;15XTbrrGLDY;15XTbrrGLDY-8-rgb_front;15XTbrrGLDY_15;15XTbrrGLDY_15-8-rgb_front;77.13;84.83;Alright, take a nice deep breath for me again.;8;9
7147;15XTbrrGLDY;15XTbrrGLDY-8-rgb_front;15XTbrrGLDY_2;15XTbrrGLDY_2-8-rgb_front;3.41;10.52;We're going to be doing some very deep cleaning on our client, and make sure that we really clear the skin out for her.;8;24
7148;15XTbrrGLDY;15XTbrrGLDY-8-rgb_front;15XTbrrGLDY_3;15XTbrrGLDY_3-8-rgb_front;10.86;15.19;So that her skin really starts to come up to more of a normal base.;8;15
7149;15XTbrrGLDY;15XTbrrGLDY-8-rgb_front;15XTbrrGLDY_4;15XTbrrGLDY_4-8-rgb_front;15.57;23.28;We're going to start with a little aroma therapy, and start her breathing into the aroma therapy so that she can get used to my hands being on her.;8;29
7150;15XTbrrGLDY;15XTbrrGLDY-8-rgb_front;15XTbrrGLDY_5_6_7_8;15XTbrrGLDY_5_6_7_8-8-rgb_front;23.85;41.5;Sarina, take a deep breath. Again. Ok. We've got some steam going, we're going to use our steam. You can hear the noise in the room.;8;26
7151;15XTbrrGLDY;15XTbrrGLDY-8-rgb_front;15XTbrrGLDY_9;15XTbrrGLDY_9-8-rgb_front;41.53;48.6;We're going to use our steam along with the softening gel, and the product that's an enzyme, to help open the pores.;8;22
7152;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_0;15bYoBr7BWs_0-8-rgb_front;0.72;1.08;Hello.;8;1
7153;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_1;15bYoBr7BWs_1-8-rgb_front;1.22;4.06;My name is Grady Johnson and I'm a professional painter.;8;10
7154;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_10;15bYoBr7BWs_10-8-rgb_front;33.8;36.79;Now on this job, it's not really peeling bad.;8;9
7155;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_11;15bYoBr7BWs_11-8-rgb_front;36.79;39.16;It doesn't get a lot of sunlight, so it's not too bad.;8;12
7156;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_12;15bYoBr7BWs_12-8-rgb_front;39.53;45.74;If you've got a lot of heavy chalking or a lot of peeling, then you want a really, really strong, gas powered pressure washer.;8;24
7157;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_13;15bYoBr7BWs_13-8-rgb_front;46.06;50.17;But on something lite like this, I just used my standard electric pressure washer.;8;14
7158;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_14;15bYoBr7BWs_14-8-rgb_front;50.46;52.81;This is only about twelve hundred psi.;8;7
7159;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_15;15bYoBr7BWs_15-8-rgb_front;52.81;54.16;There's not a lot to it.;8;6
7160;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_16;15bYoBr7BWs_16-8-rgb_front;54.37;56.58;So it doesn't have as much strength as a big one.;8;11
7161;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_17;15bYoBr7BWs_17-8-rgb_front;56.83;60.47;But it's not going to need as much because mostly we're just going to get the dirt off.;8;18
7162;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_18;15bYoBr7BWs_18-8-rgb_front;60.47;64.06;We're going to take out these old cobwebs that are up in the eaves, that kind of thing.;8;18
7163;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_19;15bYoBr7BWs_19-8-rgb_front;64.45;68.59;This is why today we're going to go ahead and use this standard old electric pressure washer.;8;17
7164;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_20;15bYoBr7BWs_20-8-rgb_front;68.81;70.13;Now, these are really easy to turn on.;8;8
7165;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_21;15bYoBr7BWs_21-8-rgb_front;70.13;71.84;It's just a button in the back, back here.;8;9
7166;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_22;15bYoBr7BWs_22-8-rgb_front;72.27;74.48;Push the button and you're going to hear it whir up.;8;11
7167;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_23;15bYoBr7BWs_23-8-rgb_front;74.48;76.17;That means the pressure is good.;8;6
7168;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_24;15bYoBr7BWs_24-8-rgb_front;76.23;79.4;Then, you just kind of want to test it and pull the trigger.;8;13
7169;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_25;15bYoBr7BWs_25-8-rgb_front;79.4;82.01;Now you can see that's already set to about fifteen degrees.;8;11
7170;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_26;15bYoBr7BWs_26-8-rgb_front;82.01;83.99;That's going to be about what I normally work with.;8;10
7171;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_27;15bYoBr7BWs_27-8-rgb_front;83.99;87.22;That's why it's kind of sucky.;8;6
7172;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_28;15bYoBr7BWs_28-8-rgb_front;87.22;88.61;Now, that's enough to clean the I.N.;8;7
7173;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_29;15bYoBr7BWs_29-8-rgb_front;88.61;90.05;It still has pretty good pressure.;8;6
7174;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_3;15bYoBr7BWs_3-8-rgb_front;5.77;9.52;Now we're going to talk a little bit about pressure washing.;8;11
7175;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_30;15bYoBr7BWs_30-8-rgb_front;90.08;92.46;This pressure washer's only about twelve hundred psi.;8;8
7176;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_31;15bYoBr7BWs_31-8-rgb_front;92.56;95.01;That's pounds per square inch.;8;5
7177;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_32;15bYoBr7BWs_32-8-rgb_front;95.19;97.77;Now, when we're working, we're hoping we're not going to find many rough areas.;8;14
7178;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_33;15bYoBr7BWs_33-8-rgb_front;97.77;99.19;That's why we're using an electric.;8;6
7179;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_34;15bYoBr7BWs_34-8-rgb_front;99.46;100.93;Because mostly we're just washing.;8;5
7180;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_35;15bYoBr7BWs_35-8-rgb_front;101.02;108.12;But if we've found a rough area we want to go ahead and go to this tip, turn it all the way to the left side and you're going to get that needle nose.;8;34
7181;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_36;15bYoBr7BWs_36-8-rgb_front;108.12;112.4;That has the maximum pressure on the pressure washer.;8;9
7182;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_37;15bYoBr7BWs_37-8-rgb_front;112.4;116.79;That'll dig out any area that you have even if you have a stubborn cobweb that's up in a corner.;8;20
7183;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_38;15bYoBr7BWs_38-8-rgb_front;117.11;118.96;But normally, you're going to keep that at about fifteen.;8;10
7184;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_39;15bYoBr7BWs_39-8-rgb_front;118.96;122.94;Now that's just a matter of turning the wand tip.;8;10
7185;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_4;15bYoBr7BWs_4-8-rgb_front;9.91;16.16;The reason we're talking about pressure washing is it's crucial to pressure wash the exterior of your house before you do any painting.;8;23
7186;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_40;15bYoBr7BWs_40-8-rgb_front;125.14;125.86;That's about right.;8;3
7187;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_41;15bYoBr7BWs_41-8-rgb_front;125.86;132.89;Now, you're going to go ahead and get that up into the eaves and we want to get the back side as well.;8;23
7188;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_42;15bYoBr7BWs_42-8-rgb_front;132.89;137.71;Then, you want to go ahead and get the reverse side too.;8;12
7189;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_43;15bYoBr7BWs_43-8-rgb_front;137.71;142.02;You see, this is a pretty good paint job.;8;9
7190;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_44;15bYoBr7BWs_44-8-rgb_front;142.06;143.23;It's holding on pretty good.;8;5
7191;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_45;15bYoBr7BWs_45-8-rgb_front;143.98;157.92;Now, I'm going to bring my facing on down.;8;9
7192;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_46;15bYoBr7BWs_46-8-rgb_front;157.92;159.72;I'll work my way down the eaves that way.;8;9
7193;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_47;15bYoBr7BWs_47-8-rgb_front;159.75;166.64;Now, once I've got to a point that I like, I want to go ahead and get the rest of this section here while I'm here instead of making a lot of moves.;8;33
7194;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_48;15bYoBr7BWs_48-8-rgb_front;166.86;169.34;So, I'm going to need to get a little higher to get these jalous eaves.;8;15
7195;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_49;15bYoBr7BWs_49-8-rgb_front;169.34;170.73;So I kind of keep a ladder handy.;8;8
7196;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_5;15bYoBr7BWs_5-8-rgb_front;16.56;19.25;It's not that you can't paint without pressure washing.;8;9
7197;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_50;15bYoBr7BWs_50-8-rgb_front;170.81;171.95;I'm going to pull that in now.;8;7
7198;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_51;15bYoBr7BWs_51-8-rgb_front;173.54;179.38;Pull that into place and jump up a couple of rungs.;8;11
7199;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_52;15bYoBr7BWs_52-8-rgb_front;179.77;182.11;Now once I'm up here, I can shoot down on it.;8;11
7200;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_53;15bYoBr7BWs_53-8-rgb_front;182.14;183.32;That way it'll work like rainwater.;8;6
7201;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_54;15bYoBr7BWs_54-8-rgb_front;183.32;190.62;This is where you really wash down all that grime.;8;10
7202;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_55;15bYoBr7BWs_55-8-rgb_front;190.62;196.72;It's a nice opportunity to get these sills too.;8;9
7203;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_56;15bYoBr7BWs_56-8-rgb_front;196.72;202.72;Now, all that's left is this bottom part on the wall.;8;11
7204;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_57;15bYoBr7BWs_57-8-rgb_front;202.72;206.01;We'll bring that on up and keep continuing on down.;8;10
7205;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_58;15bYoBr7BWs_58-8-rgb_front;206.04;210.67;This is how you pressure wash the exterior surface of a house to prepare it for painting.;8;17
7206;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_6;15bYoBr7BWs_6-8-rgb_front;19.28;23.84;It's just that the paint's not going to stick as well as it will adhere to a cleaner surface.;8;19
7207;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_7;15bYoBr7BWs_7-8-rgb_front;24.24;26.78;Now, with pressure washers there's a couple of kinds you can get.;8;12
7208;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_8;15bYoBr7BWs_8-8-rgb_front;26.84;29.75;You can get the gas powered ones which are the best and the strongest.;8;14
7209;15bYoBr7BWs;15bYoBr7BWs-8-rgb_front;15bYoBr7BWs_9;15bYoBr7BWs_9-8-rgb_front;30.06;33.3;Or you can get something like I'm using today, an electric pressure washer.;8;13
7210;15h_ez8ggVY;15h_ez8ggVY-8-rgb_front;15h_ez8ggVY_0;15h_ez8ggVY_0-8-rgb_front;0.44;4.31;In the next area, what we're going to talk about is the mouthpieces.;8;13
7211;15h_ez8ggVY;15h_ez8ggVY-8-rgb_front;15h_ez8ggVY_1;15h_ez8ggVY_1-8-rgb_front;4.68;10.72;One of the requirements for USA Boxing for competition, is to actually have a form fitted mouthpiece.;8;17
7212;15h_ez8ggVY;15h_ez8ggVY-8-rgb_front;15h_ez8ggVY_10;15h_ez8ggVY_10-8-rgb_front;57.58;66.17;And, you're not getting the full capacity of a good mouthpiece by trying to cut down a adult one into a youth size.;8;23
7213;15h_ez8ggVY;15h_ez8ggVY-8-rgb_front;15h_ez8ggVY_11;15h_ez8ggVY_11-8-rgb_front;66.17;67.61;So, make sure you have a good assortment of those.;8;10
7214;15h_ez8ggVY;15h_ez8ggVY-8-rgb_front;15h_ez8ggVY_12;15h_ez8ggVY_12-8-rgb_front;70.74;75.82;What we like to do, is we just take a cup of water and throw it in a microwave for two and a half minutes.;8;25
7215;15h_ez8ggVY;15h_ez8ggVY-8-rgb_front;15h_ez8ggVY_13;15h_ez8ggVY_13-8-rgb_front;76.32;78.71;We don't actually boil the mouthpiece itself.;8;7
7216;15h_ez8ggVY;15h_ez8ggVY-8-rgb_front;15h_ez8ggVY_14;15h_ez8ggVY_14-8-rgb_front;79.17;85.4;"We'll take a cup of boiled water; we'll drop the mouthpiece in there for about twenty seconds.";8;17
7217;15h_ez8ggVY;15h_ez8ggVY-8-rgb_front;15h_ez8ggVY_15;15h_ez8ggVY_15-8-rgb_front;85.77;87.75;And, then pour that into the sink.;8;7
7218;15h_ez8ggVY;15h_ez8ggVY-8-rgb_front;15h_ez8ggVY_16;15h_ez8ggVY_16-8-rgb_front;88.14;94.42;The boxer takes the mouthpiece out of the sink, just shakes it a bit to get the excess water out of there and slides it in his mouth.;8;28
7219;15h_ez8ggVY;15h_ez8ggVY-8-rgb_front;15h_ez8ggVY_17;15h_ez8ggVY_17-8-rgb_front;94.77;98.74;And, what I have them do is once it's in their mouth I have them push down on the sides.;8;20
7220;15h_ez8ggVY;15h_ez8ggVY-8-rgb_front;15h_ez8ggVY_18;15h_ez8ggVY_18-8-rgb_front;99.81;105.65;And, then suck really hard and then bite so they're bottom teeth and bottom teeth both make an indentation in there.;8;21
7221;15h_ez8ggVY;15h_ez8ggVY-8-rgb_front;15h_ez8ggVY_19;15h_ez8ggVY_19-8-rgb_front;106.02;107.22;And, hold it for about a minute.;8;7
7222;15h_ez8ggVY;15h_ez8ggVY-8-rgb_front;15h_ez8ggVY_2;15h_ez8ggVY_2-8-rgb_front;11.12;20.05;The old rubber mouthpieces that you just insert and use temporarily, like maybe in a gym in a sparring match or if the boxer forgets his mouthpiece.;8;27
7223;15h_ez8ggVY;15h_ez8ggVY-8-rgb_front;15h_ez8ggVY_20;15h_ez8ggVY_20-8-rgb_front;108.09;110.11;And, then once you take it out run it under cold water.;8;12

7233;15sMl7bHH5s;15sMl7bHH5s-8-rgb_front;15sMl7bHH5s_0;15sMl7bHH5s_0-8-rgb_front;0.66;3.99;Hi, I'm Gretchen Rivas with Relax To The Max Massage Therapy.;8;11
7234;15sMl7bHH5s;15sMl7bHH5s-8-rgb_front;15sMl7bHH5s_1;15sMl7bHH5s_1-8-rgb_front;3.99;6.79;And today we're going to talk about, how to find a massage therapist.;8;13
7235;15sMl7bHH5s;15sMl7bHH5s-8-rgb_front;15sMl7bHH5s_10;15sMl7bHH5s_10-8-rgb_front;79.74;82.91;And so, this is how you would look and find a massage therapist.;8;13
7236;15sMl7bHH5s;15sMl7bHH5s-8-rgb_front;15sMl7bHH5s_2;15sMl7bHH5s_2-8-rgb_front;7.39;16.01;If you are in town visiting, one of the things you can do is, you can look on-line, or you can also look in the yellow pages, and call one of those adds.;8;33
7237;15sMl7bHH5s;15sMl7bHH5s-8-rgb_front;15sMl7bHH5s_3;15sMl7bHH5s_3-8-rgb_front;16.36;24.45;Now if you're in town and you just decided to try massage therapy for the first time, one of the best resources is of course, people that you know and referrals.;8;31
7238;15sMl7bHH5s;15sMl7bHH5s-8-rgb_front;15sMl7bHH5s_4;15sMl7bHH5s_4-8-rgb_front;24.81;31.68;So I would ask your friends and family if they ever received massage, and if they did, if they liked it, and who they used, and that's the best way to go.;8;32
7239;15sMl7bHH5s;15sMl7bHH5s-8-rgb_front;15sMl7bHH5s_5;15sMl7bHH5s_5-8-rgb_front;32.03;47.04;Another way you can go is, amtamassage.org is for the American Massage Therapy Association, they have a list of all their professionals on-line, and they're certified and registered massage therapist, so that's the safe way to go.;8;37
7240;15sMl7bHH5s;15sMl7bHH5s-8-rgb_front;15sMl7bHH5s_6;15sMl7bHH5s_6-8-rgb_front;47.47;58.11;When you do find somebody you want, ask them some questions, find out how long they've been licensed, how long they've been practicing, and what type of massage therapy that they do, to make sure that they can meet your massage needs.;8;42
7241;15sMl7bHH5s;15sMl7bHH5s-8-rgb_front;15sMl7bHH5s_7;15sMl7bHH5s_7-8-rgb_front;58.57;60.69;And then ask them any other questions that you might have.;8;11
7242;15sMl7bHH5s;15sMl7bHH5s-8-rgb_front;15sMl7bHH5s_8;15sMl7bHH5s_8-8-rgb_front;60.69;74.93;And when you go to visit them, if you're not comfortable, you do have the right to speak up and say something, and also to terminate the massage at anytime, so don't forget that, if the massage therapist goes to deep, or you don't like the work, you do have the right to say no.;8;55
7243;15sMl7bHH5s;15sMl7bHH5s-8-rgb_front;15sMl7bHH5s_9;15sMl7bHH5s_9-8-rgb_front;75.33;79.38;But in general, massage is a very enjoyable experience, and it should be.;8;13
7244;163ylBUtKlI;163ylBUtKlI-8-rgb_front;163ylBUtKlI_0;163ylBUtKlI_0-8-rgb_front;0.61;14.21;Now, the thing about creative drama is, and this is where it's going to get a little tricky, depending on where you are and what the rules and regulations of your state and your educational system are.;8;37
7245;163ylBUtKlI;163ylBUtKlI-8-rgb_front;163ylBUtKlI_1;163ylBUtKlI_1-8-rgb_front;15.49;20.43;The educational system today is geared to teaching to the test.;8;11
7246;163ylBUtKlI;163ylBUtKlI-8-rgb_front;163ylBUtKlI_10;163ylBUtKlI_10-8-rgb_front;93.15;103.06;But, I encourage you to turn that material into dramas, take the time to do it, because the students will retain it longer.;8;23
7247;163ylBUtKlI;163ylBUtKlI-8-rgb_front;163ylBUtKlI_2;163ylBUtKlI_2-8-rgb_front;21.2;31.22;And teachers have a tremendous amount of pressure to get X, Y, Z amount of material learned before this test and on and on the story goes.;8;27
7248;163ylBUtKlI;163ylBUtKlI-8-rgb_front;163ylBUtKlI_3;163ylBUtKlI_3-8-rgb_front;32.17;38.07;Creative drama is not about teaching to the test, it's better.;8;11

7250;163ylBUtKlI;163ylBUtKlI-8-rgb_front;163ylBUtKlI_5;163ylBUtKlI_5-8-rgb_front;51.61;62.8;The students will be able to retain the material longer than by simply teaching to the test with the direct style of teaching that you're using in your classroom right now.;8;31
7251;163ylBUtKlI;163ylBUtKlI-8-rgb_front;163ylBUtKlI_6;163ylBUtKlI_6-8-rgb_front;63.55;72.61;Students come up to me, ten, fifteen, twenty years later, all the time, and tell me that they still remember this activity, or this activity, or that activity.;8;28
7252;163ylBUtKlI;163ylBUtKlI-8-rgb_front;163ylBUtKlI_7;163ylBUtKlI_7-8-rgb_front;73.48;82.4;How many students come up ten, twenty, thirty years later and talk about the activities, the things that they learned when they were taught to the test?;8;27
7253;163ylBUtKlI;163ylBUtKlI-8-rgb_front;163ylBUtKlI_8;163ylBUtKlI_8-8-rgb_front;83.51;86.3;It's a totally different style of teaching.;8;7
7254;163ylBUtKlI;163ylBUtKlI-8-rgb_front;163ylBUtKlI_9;163ylBUtKlI_9-8-rgb_front;86.96;92.65;So, you can still teach towards the test, in the sense of teaching the same material.;8;16

7367;16y-dsX1MDk;16y-dsX1MDk-8-rgb_front;16y-dsX1MDk_13;16y-dsX1MDk_13-8-rgb_front;74.49;79.74;We might choose an eleven by fourteen and it fits in that really nicely.;8;14

7371;16y-dsX1MDk;16y-dsX1MDk-8-rgb_front;16y-dsX1MDk_17;16y-dsX1MDk_17-8-rgb_front;90.14;96.16;So then, what we want to do is we'll pick the matting that goes with it.;8;16
7372;16y-dsX1MDk;16y-dsX1MDk-8-rgb_front;16y-dsX1MDk_18;16y-dsX1MDk_18-8-rgb_front;96.74;103.88;So, for me, I've picked these two colors that I think would go very nicely with this picture.;8;18
7373;16y-dsX1MDk;16y-dsX1MDk-8-rgb_front;16y-dsX1MDk_19;16y-dsX1MDk_19-8-rgb_front;107.98;118.31;So you can take a simple picture of your cat or your dog or your children and make an absolutely gorgeous frame for it.;8;24

7377;16y-dsX1MDk;16y-dsX1MDk-8-rgb_front;16y-dsX1MDk_5;16y-dsX1MDk_5-8-rgb_front;32.78;40.51;So, this particular ready made is an eleven by fourteen and it regularly sells for three hundred and thirty five dollars.;8;21
7378;16y-dsX1MDk;16y-dsX1MDk-8-rgb_front;16y-dsX1MDk_6;16y-dsX1MDk_6-8-rgb_front;41.13;44.02;But with already mades, we cut the price almost in half.;8;11

7541;17wK8JXEJvo;17wK8JXEJvo-8-rgb_front;17wK8JXEJvo_10;17wK8JXEJvo_10-8-rgb_front;102.1;108.22;So go ahead and take it to your machine we're just going to run two stitches on either side and then a stitch down the center.;8;26
7542;17wK8JXEJvo;17wK8JXEJvo-8-rgb_front;17wK8JXEJvo_11_12;17wK8JXEJvo_11_12-8-rgb_front;109.69;157.81;You want to go back and forth a few times just to make sure that's pretty secured. Go ahead and do the center seam the same way again I like to make these fairly large because if you do want to say use one of those two litter bottles of water or I think a liter in a half, those are fairly large cause you do want to give space for them to fairly fit.;8;75
7543;17wK8JXEJvo;17wK8JXEJvo-8-rgb_front;17wK8JXEJvo_13;17wK8JXEJvo_13-8-rgb_front;158.0;174.9;Then do your last seam and now you are ready to pin it to the rest of your lining pieces.;8;20
7544;17wK8JXEJvo;17wK8JXEJvo-8-rgb_front;17wK8JXEJvo_2;17wK8JXEJvo_2-8-rgb_front;16.94;22.11;So this will make it so easy if you're going grocery shopping and have a few bottles so they don't slide around.;8;22
7545;17wK8JXEJvo;17wK8JXEJvo-8-rgb_front;17wK8JXEJvo_3;17wK8JXEJvo_3-8-rgb_front;22.6;30.23;Also if you're going on a picnic if you don't drink of course, you can just add some bottle of water or ice tea or something like that.;8;28
7546;17wK8JXEJvo;17wK8JXEJvo-8-rgb_front;17wK8JXEJvo_4;17wK8JXEJvo_4-8-rgb_front;30.53;39.24;So what I did was just take a piece of elastic and your just going to measure out the same size as your bag.;8;24
7547;17wK8JXEJvo;17wK8JXEJvo-8-rgb_front;17wK8JXEJvo_5;17wK8JXEJvo_5-8-rgb_front;39.9;57.27;You want to leave about three inches on either side and just go ahead and cut, your going to find your center point put a pin and take two more pins.;8;31
7548;17wK8JXEJvo;17wK8JXEJvo-8-rgb_front;17wK8JXEJvo_6;17wK8JXEJvo_6-8-rgb_front;59.42;69.06;I'm just going to give about two fingers worth ease because what you want theoretically is for this to be able to stretch and securely hold your wine bottles.;8;29
7549;17wK8JXEJvo;17wK8JXEJvo-8-rgb_front;17wK8JXEJvo_7;17wK8JXEJvo_7-8-rgb_front;69.4;71.6;So two fingers of ease would be great.;8;8
7550;17wK8JXEJvo;17wK8JXEJvo-8-rgb_front;17wK8JXEJvo_8;17wK8JXEJvo_8-8-rgb_front;73.34;92.2;Then you're going to put a pin on each side again just put your two fingers, then you can trim some of the excess.;8;24
7551;17wK8JXEJvo;17wK8JXEJvo-8-rgb_front;17wK8JXEJvo_9;17wK8JXEJvo_9-8-rgb_front;92.23;101.26;You do want to leave a little bit of excess into the seam allowance cause this will just make sure that once you stitch everything up that your wine holder is secured.;8;32

7557;1835p3jEejw;1835p3jEejw-8-rgb_front;1835p3jEejw_13;1835p3jEejw_13-8-rgb_front;72.57;88.62;We showed you the, in one of the other clips, the lighthouse, the light tent, this is very similar to that and it's just a basic setup to shoot jewelry, a couple of lights, a piece of white paper or plexi-glass and a couple of white and silver reflectors along with your camera and tripod.;8;55
7558;1835p3jEejw;1835p3jEejw-8-rgb_front;1835p3jEejw_14;1835p3jEejw_14-8-rgb_front;88.72;89.83;That'll get you started.;8;4

7792;19loES0r7_4;19loES0r7_4-8-rgb_front;19loES0r7_4_10;19loES0r7_4_10-8-rgb_front;78.59;80.81;They are patterned for comfort.;8;5

7795;19loES0r7_4;19loES0r7_4-8-rgb_front;19loES0r7_4_13;19loES0r7_4_13-8-rgb_front;91.95;93.84;So glasses, safety dam.;8;4
7796;19loES0r7_4;19loES0r7_4-8-rgb_front;19loES0r7_4_14;19loES0r7_4_14-8-rgb_front;94.18;102.38;Next thing I'm going to talk to you about is a table saw when we talk about safety in carpenter tools, a table saw is a good place to start.;8;30
7797;19loES0r7_4;19loES0r7_4-8-rgb_front;19loES0r7_4_15;19loES0r7_4_15-8-rgb_front;103.31;119.16;Whether it's - this is a contractor's saw so it's one of the larger ones, but whether you're working with this type or even a small table saw type, the most important thing is to make sure you do proper things to ensure your safety.;8;45
7798;19loES0r7_4;19loES0r7_4-8-rgb_front;19loES0r7_4_16;19loES0r7_4_16-8-rgb_front;119.7;127.91;This is the guard, now this is a standard guard that comes with any table saw, but whenever you are actually getting the act of sawing you want to make sure that's down.;8;33
7799;19loES0r7_4;19loES0r7_4-8-rgb_front;19loES0r7_4_17;19loES0r7_4_17-8-rgb_front;128.49;141.52;Now whenever you do something on the blade, such as changing the blade, you want to make sure that you unplug, so never work on any power tool as far as changing the blades unless it's unplugged.;8;37
7800;19loES0r7_4;19loES0r7_4-8-rgb_front;19loES0r7_4_18;19loES0r7_4_18-8-rgb_front;142.79;156.42;Here, I have a feather fence which is made and the feather fence will allow you to hold pieces against, so that will provide extra security in sawing.;8;28
7801;19loES0r7_4;19loES0r7_4-8-rgb_front;19loES0r7_4_19;19loES0r7_4_19-8-rgb_front;156.69;161.38;And then you have other things such as push blocks, and a push stick.;8;14
7802;19loES0r7_4;19loES0r7_4-8-rgb_front;19loES0r7_4_2;19loES0r7_4_2-8-rgb_front;9.25;19.74;Now the most important thing is that when you are working on any kind of power tools or even hand tools and maybe even something as simple as hammering a nail.;8;31
7803;19loES0r7_4;19loES0r7_4-8-rgb_front;19loES0r7_4_20;19loES0r7_4_20-8-rgb_front;161.78;167.62;These help you to guide things through, keeps your fingers away from the cutting surfaces.;8;15
7804;19loES0r7_4;19loES0r7_4-8-rgb_front;19loES0r7_4_21;19loES0r7_4_21-8-rgb_front;168.06;172.91;So just some basic safety tips there and I'm Tim Gipson talking about carpenter safety.;8;15
7805;19loES0r7_4;19loES0r7_4-8-rgb_front;19loES0r7_4_3;19loES0r7_4_3-8-rgb_front;20.4;26.6;The first and most important thing that you can have for safety gear is to have your safety glasses.;8;19
7806;19loES0r7_4;19loES0r7_4-8-rgb_front;19loES0r7_4_4;19loES0r7_4_4-8-rgb_front;27.72;35.66;So - and if they're a little dirty you can clean them up... but you only have two eyes so you want to make sure you protect them.;8;28
7807;19loES0r7_4;19loES0r7_4-8-rgb_front;19loES0r7_4_5;19loES0r7_4_5-8-rgb_front;36.14;49.83;Some other gear that you have if you are dealing with tickly dusty conditions which is you deal with a lot when any time you're doing any kind of construction is the dust mask.;8;34
7808;19loES0r7_4;19loES0r7_4-8-rgb_front;19loES0r7_4_6;19loES0r7_4_6-8-rgb_front;49.83;53.13;Now these come in various types, this is just your basic dust mask.;8;13
7809;19loES0r7_4;19loES0r7_4-8-rgb_front;19loES0r7_4_7;19loES0r7_4_7-8-rgb_front;53.61;68.49;You have others that actually are upgraded and can have respirators in them, or vent valves so that are used for more such things as paint, or fine particle sanding, such as in drywall.;8;34
7810;19loES0r7_4;19loES0r7_4-8-rgb_front;19loES0r7_4_8;19loES0r7_4_8-8-rgb_front;70.87;74.0;And then the next article is protect your hands.;8;9

7813;1A1mzX1-l9g;1A1mzX1-l9g-8-rgb_front;1A1mzX1-l9g_1;1A1mzX1-l9g_1-8-rgb_front;6.86;37.3;We are going to use the soft drier oasis for it because the container has a small little step down here with the pedestal we are going to put a hot glob of glue at the base of it and that will fill it in a little bit and then you need to put a top one in and cut the corners off that you measured to stick on the top of that.;8;73
7814;1A1mzX1-l9g;1A1mzX1-l9g-8-rgb_front;1A1mzX1-l9g_2;1A1mzX1-l9g_2-8-rgb_front;37.95;40.07;You don't have to go crazy with the oasis.;8;9
7815;1A1mzX1-l9g;1A1mzX1-l9g-8-rgb_front;1A1mzX1-l9g_3;1A1mzX1-l9g_3-8-rgb_front;42.25;62.57;We tend to do a lot of that here in America but a small piece of oasis is find to use then you take your floral tape and you will run it across in opposite directions on both ends, cut it off.;8;42
7816;1A1mzX1-l9g;1A1mzX1-l9g-8-rgb_front;1A1mzX1-l9g_4;1A1mzX1-l9g_4-8-rgb_front;62.57;87.7;You can let it go a little bit beyond, it doesn't matter, and then I like to take a piece and make sure it is totally anchored by going all the way around your container and this tends to stick it a lot better when it is stuck to itself so make sure you overlap it.;8;56
7817;1A1mzX1-l9g;1A1mzX1-l9g-8-rgb_front;1A1mzX1-l9g_5;1A1mzX1-l9g_5-8-rgb_front;89.29;92.11;Then you can come back and cut your tails off.;8;10
7818;1A1mzX1-l9g;1A1mzX1-l9g-8-rgb_front;1A1mzX1-l9g_6;1A1mzX1-l9g_6-8-rgb_front;99.3;109.87;This will help you anchor your flowers into your container so they won't fall out so the next thing you need to do is go ahead and anchor your oasis down into that container.;8;34
7819;1A25qZmkliU;1A25qZmkliU-8-rgb_front;1A25qZmkliU_0;1A25qZmkliU_0-8-rgb_front;0.52;4.26;Now we're going to construct our ears for our animal purses.;8;11
7820;1A25qZmkliU;1A25qZmkliU-8-rgb_front;1A25qZmkliU_1;1A25qZmkliU_1-8-rgb_front;4.82;11.96;We got the panda face done, we have our cat face done, and now we're going to make the other ear for the cat.;8;24
7821;1A25qZmkliU;1A25qZmkliU-8-rgb_front;1A25qZmkliU_10;1A25qZmkliU_10-8-rgb_front;69.65;74.19;Just make sure you're getting to the edge of the fabric and you'll know you're catching the wire.;8;18
7822;1A25qZmkliU;1A25qZmkliU-8-rgb_front;1A25qZmkliU_11;1A25qZmkliU_11-8-rgb_front;74.63;80.73;You're going to continue this all the way around the edge of the ear.;8;14
7823;1A25qZmkliU;1A25qZmkliU-8-rgb_front;1A25qZmkliU_12;1A25qZmkliU_12-8-rgb_front;81.35;83.93;So, I'm going to finish up sewing my ear.;8;9
7824;1A25qZmkliU;1A25qZmkliU-8-rgb_front;1A25qZmkliU_13;1A25qZmkliU_13-8-rgb_front;84.94;88.88;Remember, just catch that wire that's inside of there.;8;9
7825;1A25qZmkliU;1A25qZmkliU-8-rgb_front;1A25qZmkliU_14;1A25qZmkliU_14-8-rgb_front;89.72;97.31;And once you have gotten down to the edge of the ear, I don't want you to, to finish this off with a knot.;8;24
7826;1A25qZmkliU;1A25qZmkliU-8-rgb_front;1A25qZmkliU_15;1A25qZmkliU_15-8-rgb_front;97.49;99.84;We're going to attach it right to the purse.;8;9
7827;1A25qZmkliU;1A25qZmkliU-8-rgb_front;1A25qZmkliU_16;1A25qZmkliU_16-8-rgb_front;100.4;102.33;Okay, so notice there's a little piece of wire there.;8;10
7828;1A25qZmkliU;1A25qZmkliU-8-rgb_front;1A25qZmkliU_17;1A25qZmkliU_17-8-rgb_front;102.33;106.52;I'm just going to bend that across so it's nice and neat.;8;12
7829;1A25qZmkliU;1A25qZmkliU-8-rgb_front;1A25qZmkliU_18;1A25qZmkliU_18-8-rgb_front;107.18;109.34;I'm going to bring my cat over here.;8;8

7831;1A25qZmkliU;1A25qZmkliU-8-rgb_front;1A25qZmkliU_2;1A25qZmkliU_2-8-rgb_front;12.27;21.13;Remember, you're going to need two pieces of your ear cut out at the same time and your piece of wire that goes in-between them.;8;25
7832;1A25qZmkliU;1A25qZmkliU-8-rgb_front;1A25qZmkliU_20;1A25qZmkliU_20-8-rgb_front;112.24;113.43;I want it right there.;8;5

7834;1A25qZmkliU;1A25qZmkliU-8-rgb_front;1A25qZmkliU_22;1A25qZmkliU_22-8-rgb_front;122.25;125.09;And just do another running stitch right across.;8;8
7835;1A25qZmkliU;1A25qZmkliU-8-rgb_front;1A25qZmkliU_23;1A25qZmkliU_23-8-rgb_front;125.09;130.18;You're going to go up, underneath, through the ear, attach it to the face and go back down.;8;18
7836;1A25qZmkliU;1A25qZmkliU-8-rgb_front;1A25qZmkliU_24;1A25qZmkliU_24-8-rgb_front;131.27;138.27;Up, underneath, and go all the way across until your ear is attached.;8;13
7837;1A25qZmkliU;1A25qZmkliU-8-rgb_front;1A25qZmkliU_25;1A25qZmkliU_25-8-rgb_front;138.27;138.93;Just like that.;8;3

7841;1A25qZmkliU;1A25qZmkliU-8-rgb_front;1A25qZmkliU_6;1A25qZmkliU_6-8-rgb_front;36.17;39.98;You're going to lift this up and hold it with your fingertips together.;8;13

7898;1AtdCMxgF2Q;1AtdCMxgF2Q-8-rgb_front;1AtdCMxgF2Q_10;1AtdCMxgF2Q_10-8-rgb_front;40.35;42.08;So, lean back into it just a little bit.;8;9
7899;1AtdCMxgF2Q;1AtdCMxgF2Q-8-rgb_front;1AtdCMxgF2Q_11;1AtdCMxgF2Q_11-8-rgb_front;42.39;45.56;"We're opening out; squeezing the shoulder blades down the spine.";8;10

7903;1AtdCMxgF2Q;1AtdCMxgF2Q-8-rgb_front;1AtdCMxgF2Q_15;1AtdCMxgF2Q_15-8-rgb_front;59.48;66.23;We're going to do this as a compound exercise so we do lats and traps, dropping down into a row.;8;20
7904;1AtdCMxgF2Q;1AtdCMxgF2Q-8-rgb_front;1AtdCMxgF2Q_16;1AtdCMxgF2Q_16-8-rgb_front;66.33;71.45;So, our combination is going to go lat and row.;8;10
7905;1AtdCMxgF2Q;1AtdCMxgF2Q-8-rgb_front;1AtdCMxgF2Q_17;1AtdCMxgF2Q_17-8-rgb_front;71.73;73.82;When you're doing your lats your elbows open wide.;8;9

7909;1AtdCMxgF2Q;1AtdCMxgF2Q-8-rgb_front;1AtdCMxgF2Q_21;1AtdCMxgF2Q_21-8-rgb_front;85.05;89.59;If it's still easy for you double up your bands and do both at the same time.;8;17

7915;1AtdCMxgF2Q;1AtdCMxgF2Q-8-rgb_front;1AtdCMxgF2Q_27;1AtdCMxgF2Q_27-8-rgb_front;106.68;109.0;The lats look like a triangle upside down.;8;8

7917;1AtdCMxgF2Q;1AtdCMxgF2Q-8-rgb_front;1AtdCMxgF2Q_29;1AtdCMxgF2Q_29-8-rgb_front;111.74;113.63;We're even trying to get up into your trap area.;8;10
7918;1AtdCMxgF2Q;1AtdCMxgF2Q-8-rgb_front;1AtdCMxgF2Q_30;1AtdCMxgF2Q_30-8-rgb_front;113.66;118.03;So, as you're pulling back engage the muscles and then release it.;8;12
7919;1AtdCMxgF2Q;1AtdCMxgF2Q-8-rgb_front;1AtdCMxgF2Q_31;1AtdCMxgF2Q_31-8-rgb_front;118.75;122.69;Sit up really tall and then lean back so that you've got your abs engaged the whole time.;8;18

7921;1AtdCMxgF2Q;1AtdCMxgF2Q-8-rgb_front;1AtdCMxgF2Q_33;1AtdCMxgF2Q_33-8-rgb_front;134.35;135.59;Either way will work.;8;4

7960;1BE6JW91TyM;1BE6JW91TyM-8-rgb_front;1BE6JW91TyM_14;1BE6JW91TyM_14-8-rgb_front;65.49;68.5;Then last but not least I'm going to have some hot water.;8;12
7961;1BE6JW91TyM;1BE6JW91TyM-8-rgb_front;1BE6JW91TyM_15;1BE6JW91TyM_15-8-rgb_front;69.01;76.36;The nice hot water will help dissolve some of the more stubborn cooked on spots on our stove top.;8;19

7965;1BE6JW91TyM;1BE6JW91TyM-8-rgb_front;1BE6JW91TyM_4;1BE6JW91TyM_4-8-rgb_front;13.73;21.06;This will help protect your hands and also allow you to use a hotter temperature of water then otherwise, you would be able to with bare hands.;8;27
7966;1BE6JW91TyM;1BE6JW91TyM-8-rgb_front;1BE6JW91TyM_5;1BE6JW91TyM_5-8-rgb_front;21.41;22.8;You also need a sponge.;8;5
7967;1BE6JW91TyM;1BE6JW91TyM-8-rgb_front;1BE6JW91TyM_6;1BE6JW91TyM_6-8-rgb_front;22.93;26.72;You need a nice soft sponge you don't want anything that is too abrasive.;8;14
7968;1BE6JW91TyM;1BE6JW91TyM-8-rgb_front;1BE6JW91TyM_7;1BE6JW91TyM_7-8-rgb_front;27.06;31.63;Otherwise it could scratch the cooking surface or different parts of your stove.;8;13
7969;1BE6JW91TyM;1BE6JW91TyM-8-rgb_front;1BE6JW91TyM_8;1BE6JW91TyM_8-8-rgb_front;32.49;34.64;We're going to use a nice all purpose cleaner.;8;9

7977;1BWKlgd8SfA;1BWKlgd8SfA-8-rgb_front;1BWKlgd8SfA_10;1BWKlgd8SfA_10-8-rgb_front;50.71;56.35;I'm going to take the thermometer and I'm going to stick it in between the breast and the thigh, go all the way in.;8;24
7978;1BWKlgd8SfA;1BWKlgd8SfA-8-rgb_front;1BWKlgd8SfA_11;1BWKlgd8SfA_11-8-rgb_front;56.38;64.21;And the proper temperature is 165 degrees for the stuffing and 185 for the turkey.;8;15
7979;1BWKlgd8SfA;1BWKlgd8SfA-8-rgb_front;1BWKlgd8SfA_12;1BWKlgd8SfA_12-8-rgb_front;64.63;73.09;So what we are also going to do is Diane likes to cover the parts that are browning at the beginning with foil.;8;23
7980;1BWKlgd8SfA;1BWKlgd8SfA-8-rgb_front;1BWKlgd8SfA_13;1BWKlgd8SfA_13-8-rgb_front;73.09;76.98;So we cover, the wings cook earlier and the legs cook a little earlier.;8;14
7981;1BWKlgd8SfA;1BWKlgd8SfA-8-rgb_front;1BWKlgd8SfA_14;1BWKlgd8SfA_14-8-rgb_front;77.47;79.23;We cover up the legs.;8;5

7984;1BWKlgd8SfA;1BWKlgd8SfA-8-rgb_front;1BWKlgd8SfA_17;1BWKlgd8SfA_17-8-rgb_front;90.62;100.74;And we will probably take the aluminum foil off on the front on the top of the breast, about a half hour before we start to glaze.;8;27
7985;1BWKlgd8SfA;1BWKlgd8SfA-8-rgb_front;1BWKlgd8SfA_18;1BWKlgd8SfA_18-8-rgb_front;100.77;103.43;It's turkey sunscreen.;8;3

7989;1BWKlgd8SfA;1BWKlgd8SfA-8-rgb_front;1BWKlgd8SfA_21;1BWKlgd8SfA_21-8-rgb_front;110.61;114.39;And we will take that off probably the last half hour before we put the glaze on.;8;17
7990;1BWKlgd8SfA;1BWKlgd8SfA-8-rgb_front;1BWKlgd8SfA_22;1BWKlgd8SfA_22-8-rgb_front;115.11;119.13;And now our wings, our legs and the top of the turkey are protected.;8;14
7991;1BWKlgd8SfA;1BWKlgd8SfA-8-rgb_front;1BWKlgd8SfA_23;1BWKlgd8SfA_23-8-rgb_front;119.89;121.53;Like sunscreen.;8;2

7993;1BWKlgd8SfA;1BWKlgd8SfA-8-rgb_front;1BWKlgd8SfA_25;1BWKlgd8SfA_25-8-rgb_front;129.57;131.78;Ok have a nice trip.;8;5

7995;1BWKlgd8SfA;1BWKlgd8SfA-8-rgb_front;1BWKlgd8SfA_4;1BWKlgd8SfA_4-8-rgb_front;17.38;21.61;We are going to roast the turkey for three and a half hours longer.;8;14

8754;1GlHmFJA0LQ;1GlHmFJA0LQ-8-rgb_front;1GlHmFJA0LQ_23;1GlHmFJA0LQ_23-8-rgb_front;146.04;149.01;So there are steps like that that you can do to make a good suit.;8;15

8759;1GlHmFJA0LQ;1GlHmFJA0LQ-8-rgb_front;1GlHmFJA0LQ_3;1GlHmFJA0LQ_3-8-rgb_front;16.67;24.18;The band is just a little bit something that's different, and it also helps your suit stay on as well.;8;20

8764;1GlHmFJA0LQ;1GlHmFJA0LQ-8-rgb_front;1GlHmFJA0LQ_8;1GlHmFJA0LQ_8-8-rgb_front;49.78;52.4;And with this suit, we did decide to do the elastic.;8;11

8794;1H55083VyWI;1H55083VyWI-8-rgb_front;1H55083VyWI_3;1H55083VyWI_3-8-rgb_front;21.61;29.69;We don't want to jack it up to such an angle that it's going to create a hazard or danger by tilting or applying too much force on the other side.;8;31
8795;1H55083VyWI;1H55083VyWI-8-rgb_front;1H55083VyWI_4;1H55083VyWI_4-8-rgb_front;29.69;39.4;So, I've got it up with the tire probably around a foot off the ground and that's more than adequate to give us plenty of room to work and keep a good safety margin.;8;34
8796;1H55083VyWI;1H55083VyWI-8-rgb_front;1H55083VyWI_5;1H55083VyWI_5-8-rgb_front;39.4;56.07;So, this time, once I've got it jacked up, I'm going to put it on a jack stand or another device to safely carry the load.;8;26
8797;1H55083VyWI;1H55083VyWI-8-rgb_front;1H55083VyWI_6;1H55083VyWI_6-8-rgb_front;56.07;64.03;I place that jack stand underneath the frame right at the very front where the unibody frame comes up and the front suspension meet.;8;24
8798;1H55083VyWI;1H55083VyWI-8-rgb_front;1H55083VyWI_7;1H55083VyWI_7-8-rgb_front;64.03;67.77;It's a good place to stabilize and carry the load.;8;10

9197;1MUKBwc84DA;1MUKBwc84DA-8-rgb_front;1MUKBwc84DA_11;1MUKBwc84DA_11-8-rgb_front;61.73;71.62;I found that this is a very handy icebreaker as some instances and also the customer appreciates you taking that extra time to make sure that you have your facts right.;8;31
9198;1MUKBwc84DA;1MUKBwc84DA-8-rgb_front;1MUKBwc84DA_12;1MUKBwc84DA_12-8-rgb_front;72.24;76.29;But again by using the customer's name you make the feel like more than just a number.;8;17
9199;1MUKBwc84DA;1MUKBwc84DA-8-rgb_front;1MUKBwc84DA_2;1MUKBwc84DA_2-8-rgb_front;7.86;14.41;Another simple factor to consider when you're dealing with a customer over the phone use that customer's name.;8;18
9200;1MUKBwc84DA;1MUKBwc84DA-8-rgb_front;1MUKBwc84DA_3;1MUKBwc84DA_3-8-rgb_front;15.48;18.35;Now when you use the customer's name, what are you doing.;8;11
9201;1MUKBwc84DA;1MUKBwc84DA-8-rgb_front;1MUKBwc84DA_4;1MUKBwc84DA_4-8-rgb_front;18.4;23.62;First of all you're telling the customer that they are an individual, nobody wants to be a number.;8;18
9202;1MUKBwc84DA;1MUKBwc84DA-8-rgb_front;1MUKBwc84DA_5;1MUKBwc84DA_5-8-rgb_front;23.81;27.37;Don't you hate it and go into a place like I don't know, DMV comes to mind.;8;17
9203;1MUKBwc84DA;1MUKBwc84DA-8-rgb_front;1MUKBwc84DA_6;1MUKBwc84DA_6-8-rgb_front;27.37;30.77;You pull a number and that is all you are to the person behind the counter.;8;16
9204;1MUKBwc84DA;1MUKBwc84DA-8-rgb_front;1MUKBwc84DA_7;1MUKBwc84DA_7-8-rgb_front;31.32;36.73;Well the person who is calling you feels anonymous immediately because they are not face to face with you.;8;19
9205;1MUKBwc84DA;1MUKBwc84DA-8-rgb_front;1MUKBwc84DA_8;1MUKBwc84DA_8-8-rgb_front;36.99;44.71;One way to establish a relationship and it's a very simple low cost very quick method is just to repeat the customer's name.;8;23
9206;1MUKBwc84DA;1MUKBwc84DA-8-rgb_front;1MUKBwc84DA_9;1MUKBwc84DA_9-8-rgb_front;45.21;53.72;Now in my experience I found that when you're dealing with a customer with a very difficult last name and believe me a lot of people have trouble with Unruh.;8;30
9233;1Mqg8dDpuIs;1Mqg8dDpuIs-8-rgb_front;1Mqg8dDpuIs_0;1Mqg8dDpuIs_0-8-rgb_front;0.47;7.52;Ok, we're right around the green, but you've hit a shot, and now we've landed in this thick grass.;8;19

9235;1Mqg8dDpuIs;1Mqg8dDpuIs-8-rgb_front;1Mqg8dDpuIs_2;1Mqg8dDpuIs_2-8-rgb_front;27.79;36.06;Other times it could be dried out, later in the day, so the key here, is making sure that you follow through.;8;22

9306;1Npqw3j6-w0;1Npqw3j6-w0-8-rgb_front;1Npqw3j6-w0_3;1Npqw3j6-w0_3-8-rgb_front;12.15;20.77;We are going to add 3/4 of a cup of sugar, you happen to have an odd size 3/4 cup measuring cup that is always much easier to work with.;8;30
9307;1Npqw3j6-w0;1Npqw3j6-w0-8-rgb_front;1Npqw3j6-w0_4;1Npqw3j6-w0_4-8-rgb_front;21.32;28.65;Otherwise you'll use your half cup and your 1/4 cup to measure and you just want to scoop the sugar into your cup.;8;23
9308;1Npqw3j6-w0;1Npqw3j6-w0-8-rgb_front;1Npqw3j6-w0_5;1Npqw3j6-w0_5-8-rgb_front;28.99;32.62;It's granulated sugar so you don't have to worry about packing it down or not.;8;15
9309;1Npqw3j6-w0;1Npqw3j6-w0-8-rgb_front;1Npqw3j6-w0_6;1Npqw3j6-w0_6-8-rgb_front;33.12;38.14;Then pour it into your butter mixture or the creamed butter.;8;11
9310;1Npqw3j6-w0;1Npqw3j6-w0-8-rgb_front;1Npqw3j6-w0_7;1Npqw3j6-w0_7-8-rgb_front;38.6;51.62;We are going to start your mixer on a lower speed to just start incorporating a little bit this is going to cause it to be almost like clumps of butter surrounded by the sugar.;8;35
9311;1Npqw3j6-w0;1Npqw3j6-w0-8-rgb_front;1Npqw3j6-w0_8;1Npqw3j6-w0_8-8-rgb_front;51.66;55.19;Then you are going to turn the mixer up just a little bit.;8;13

9339;1O3BRZq7AYY;1O3BRZq7AYY-8-rgb_front;1O3BRZq7AYY_10;1O3BRZq7AYY_10-8-rgb_front;73.5;91.73;If you're really not sure about which kind of kiwi you're going to enjoy, like I said the ones that are a little more golden like that are going to be a little bit more tender, or a little bit more solid, sorry, a little bit more firm, and the darker ones are going to be a little bit more squishy.;8;61
9340;1O3BRZq7AYY;1O3BRZq7AYY-8-rgb_front;1O3BRZq7AYY_11;1O3BRZq7AYY_11-8-rgb_front;91.73;108.32;If you're really not sure which one you like you can ask the produce manager at the farm market to take them to the back and cut one open for you or cut them both open for you and he'll give you a taste test and you can go off of that judgment as to which ones you're going to come out here and pick for yourself to take home.;8;70
9341;1OJx7Vfnr6w;1OJx7Vfnr6w-8-rgb_front;1OJx7Vfnr6w_0;1OJx7Vfnr6w_0-8-rgb_front;0.74;4.53;Hi I'm Emily Larew, and we are working on our intermediate tap steps.;8;13
9342;1OJx7Vfnr6w;1OJx7Vfnr6w-8-rgb_front;1OJx7Vfnr6w_1;1OJx7Vfnr6w_1-8-rgb_front;4.88;7.67;We're going to take a look at how to do a triple drawback.;8;13
9343;1OJx7Vfnr6w;1OJx7Vfnr6w-8-rgb_front;1OJx7Vfnr6w_10;1OJx7Vfnr6w_10-8-rgb_front;75.79;80.58;Those were your single, double, and triple drawbacks all combined after you learn your triple drawback.;8;16
9344;1OJx7Vfnr6w;1OJx7Vfnr6w-8-rgb_front;1OJx7Vfnr6w_2;1OJx7Vfnr6w_2-8-rgb_front;8.0;12.99;So, remember if you looked previously at our double drawbacks, we just added another heel.;8;15
9345;1OJx7Vfnr6w;1OJx7Vfnr6w-8-rgb_front;1OJx7Vfnr6w_3;1OJx7Vfnr6w_3-8-rgb_front;13.27;16.39;So this time we have three heels, okay.;8;8
9346;1OJx7Vfnr6w;1OJx7Vfnr6w-8-rgb_front;1OJx7Vfnr6w_4;1OJx7Vfnr6w_4-8-rgb_front;16.61;24.87;So, knees bent, weight forward, we're going to do brush, heel, step, front, back, so that's your three heel sounds.;8;20
9347;1OJx7Vfnr6w;1OJx7Vfnr6w-8-rgb_front;1OJx7Vfnr6w_5;1OJx7Vfnr6w_5-8-rgb_front;25.46;31.26;Brush, heel, step, front, back, one more time, brush, heel, step, front, back.;8;13
9348;1OJx7Vfnr6w;1OJx7Vfnr6w-8-rgb_front;1OJx7Vfnr6w_6;1OJx7Vfnr6w_6-8-rgb_front;31.55;37.86;Again keep your body and your tap steps like right underneath your body, because otherwise it's going to be really hard to make it fast.;8;25
9349;1OJx7Vfnr6w;1OJx7Vfnr6w-8-rgb_front;1OJx7Vfnr6w_7;1OJx7Vfnr6w_7-8-rgb_front;38.8;50.78;Brush, heel, step, front, back, brush, heel, step, front, back, brush, heel, step, front, back, brush, heel, step, front, back, da da da da da, alright.;8;26
9350;1OJx7Vfnr6w;1OJx7Vfnr6w-8-rgb_front;1OJx7Vfnr6w_8;1OJx7Vfnr6w_8-8-rgb_front;51.86;62.82;So if we want to go ahead and add like a combination with our singles, doubles, and triples, we would do it like this.;8;24
9351;1OJx7Vfnr6w;1OJx7Vfnr6w-8-rgb_front;1OJx7Vfnr6w_9;1OJx7Vfnr6w_9-8-rgb_front;62.82;75.76;And a one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, awesome.;8;11
9352;1OURLZ-4Xeo;1OURLZ-4Xeo-8-rgb_front;1OURLZ-4Xeo_0;1OURLZ-4Xeo_0-8-rgb_front;3.43;8.18;There are many different types of mountain bikes that you can take our for general ride in the woods.;8;19
9353;1OURLZ-4Xeo;1OURLZ-4Xeo-8-rgb_front;1OURLZ-4Xeo_1;1OURLZ-4Xeo_1-8-rgb_front;9.0;15.86;Today I have chosen one specific type that I might make my ride a little bit more challenging in some of the other bikes that you could choose.;8;28
9354;1OURLZ-4Xeo;1OURLZ-4Xeo-8-rgb_front;1OURLZ-4Xeo_11;1OURLZ-4Xeo_11-8-rgb_front;112.9;124.15;You can ride a $500 bike and learn maybe more of the back then a bike that cost $5000 because the bike isn't you know correcting so many of your mistakes.;8;31
9355;1OURLZ-4Xeo;1OURLZ-4Xeo-8-rgb_front;1OURLZ-4Xeo_2;1OURLZ-4Xeo_2-8-rgb_front;16.23;22.16;My bike has no suspension in the front, not suspension in the rear, it does have a full set of gears and really good brakes.;8;25
9356;1OURLZ-4Xeo;1OURLZ-4Xeo-8-rgb_front;1OURLZ-4Xeo_3;1OURLZ-4Xeo_3-8-rgb_front;22.68;33.31;But this bike not having any suspension in the front of the rear you know other bikes has springs and damper up to like 5-6 inches of travel that people use for this sort of application.;8;36
9357;1OURLZ-4Xeo;1OURLZ-4Xeo-8-rgb_front;1OURLZ-4Xeo_4;1OURLZ-4Xeo_4-8-rgb_front;34.98;50.78;But having suspension allows you to do is take lines that are rougher, it keeps your bike more stable and level in rough terrain and it keeps your tires on the ground so you can get better tractions so you can brake later you can turn harder and all that other sort of stuff.;8;54

9378;1Oj0xMGOmqc;1Oj0xMGOmqc-8-rgb_front;1Oj0xMGOmqc_4;1Oj0xMGOmqc_4-8-rgb_front;21.86;29.58;It might have one pad on top for both the bone out and the toe and your high back will fold down so you can enter through the back.;8;29

9382;1Oj0xMGOmqc;1Oj0xMGOmqc-8-rgb_front;1Oj0xMGOmqc_8;1Oj0xMGOmqc_8-8-rgb_front;37.56;44.94;They might not even be snowboard bindings at all if you have an alpine or racing board, because yours are going to look a lot similar to a ski binding.;8;30
9383;1Oj0xMGOmqc;1Oj0xMGOmqc-8-rgb_front;1Oj0xMGOmqc_9;1Oj0xMGOmqc_9-8-rgb_front;45.29;49.27;Flat to the board and you're not going to use a snowboarding boot.;8;13
9384;1Ot-mwXOTuQ;1Ot-mwXOTuQ-8-rgb_front;1Ot-mwXOTuQ_0;1Ot-mwXOTuQ_0-8-rgb_front;0.18;5.6;We just stretched out the hips so let's balance now our center or our core.;8;15
9385;1Ot-mwXOTuQ;1Ot-mwXOTuQ-8-rgb_front;1Ot-mwXOTuQ_1;1Ot-mwXOTuQ_1-8-rgb_front;5.87;13.31;So Julie is going to lift up out of pigeon pose, swing that right leg around as you shift the weight into the left hip.;8;25
9386;1Ot-mwXOTuQ;1Ot-mwXOTuQ-8-rgb_front;1Ot-mwXOTuQ_10;1Ot-mwXOTuQ_10-8-rgb_front;54.15;65.87;At any time if you feel pressure on the low back bend the knees or clasp the hands around the back side of the knees to release that pressure keeping the energy focused on the abdominals.;8;36
9387;1Ot-mwXOTuQ;1Ot-mwXOTuQ-8-rgb_front;1Ot-mwXOTuQ_11;1Ot-mwXOTuQ_11-8-rgb_front;66.93;67.74;That's great.;8;2
9388;1Ot-mwXOTuQ;1Ot-mwXOTuQ-8-rgb_front;1Ot-mwXOTuQ_2;1Ot-mwXOTuQ_2-8-rgb_front;13.31;16.79;Then I'm going to place a blanket underneath the tail bone for this next position.;8;15
9389;1Ot-mwXOTuQ;1Ot-mwXOTuQ-8-rgb_front;1Ot-mwXOTuQ_3;1Ot-mwXOTuQ_3-8-rgb_front;17.15;18.96;You may or may not need the blanket.;8;8

9391;1Ot-mwXOTuQ;1Ot-mwXOTuQ-8-rgb_front;1Ot-mwXOTuQ_5;1Ot-mwXOTuQ_5-8-rgb_front;29.36;30.82;So that's one variation.;8;4
9392;1Ot-mwXOTuQ;1Ot-mwXOTuQ-8-rgb_front;1Ot-mwXOTuQ_6;1Ot-mwXOTuQ_6-8-rgb_front;30.82;34.05;If you would like you can straighten the legs completely.;8;10
9393;1Ot-mwXOTuQ;1Ot-mwXOTuQ-8-rgb_front;1Ot-mwXOTuQ_7;1Ot-mwXOTuQ_7-8-rgb_front;34.09;36.92;This is boat pose or navasana.;8;6
9394;1Ot-mwXOTuQ;1Ot-mwXOTuQ-8-rgb_front;1Ot-mwXOTuQ_8;1Ot-mwXOTuQ_8-8-rgb_front;36.92;50.38;It is very trying on that center so breath deeply trying to keep the chest up, pretend that there is a nice candle and a flame flickering behind you and you want to lift away from that flame.;8;38
9395;1Ot-mwXOTuQ;1Ot-mwXOTuQ-8-rgb_front;1Ot-mwXOTuQ_9;1Ot-mwXOTuQ_9-8-rgb_front;51.25;54.08;So you are keeping your boat out of the water, keeping the legs extended.;8;14
9396;1OxarI6IjP4;1OxarI6IjP4-8-rgb_front;1OxarI6IjP4_0;1OxarI6IjP4_0-8-rgb_front;0.57;9.77;OK, now we're going to be using the seven iron, which is, this one is thirty six degree loft, which means you can see that it's angles pretty substantially still.;8;30
9397;1OxarI6IjP4;1OxarI6IjP4-8-rgb_front;1OxarI6IjP4_1;1OxarI6IjP4_1-8-rgb_front;10.14;15.51;So this club as we go down, the clubs are going to be hitting the ball further and further.;8;19
9398;1OxarI6IjP4;1OxarI6IjP4-8-rgb_front;1OxarI6IjP4_2;1OxarI6IjP4_2-8-rgb_front;15.78;19.75;So, a seven iron is going to hit the ball further than an eight iron, further than a nine iron.;8;20
9399;1OxarI6IjP4;1OxarI6IjP4-8-rgb_front;1OxarI6IjP4_3;1OxarI6IjP4_3-8-rgb_front;19.75;27.18;So this club, for most good recreational players they're hitting it from a hundred and forty to about one hundred and seventy.;8;22
9400;1OxarI6IjP4;1OxarI6IjP4-8-rgb_front;1OxarI6IjP4_4;1OxarI6IjP4_4-8-rgb_front;27.56;34.72;And the big variation is some players are stronger, some are taller, some have better swings, and so on and so forth.;8;22
9401;1OxarI6IjP4;1OxarI6IjP4-8-rgb_front;1OxarI6IjP4_5;1OxarI6IjP4_5-8-rgb_front;34.99;45.62;But this club is very useful once again, so if you're not a four hundred yard power for and you've hit a two hundred fifty yard drive, you've got a seven iron for most players into the green.;8;38
9402;1OxarI6IjP4;1OxarI6IjP4-8-rgb_front;1OxarI6IjP4_6;1OxarI6IjP4_6-8-rgb_front;45.95;49.18;So this shot is the shot that really can make or break the hole.;8;14
9403;1OxarI6IjP4;1OxarI6IjP4-8-rgb_front;1OxarI6IjP4_7;1OxarI6IjP4_7-8-rgb_front;49.38;54.17;So if this shot is accurate, you have a good chance of making a putt in one or two putts.;8;20

9586;1PwvyT44-uE;1PwvyT44-uE-8-rgb_front;1PwvyT44-uE_18;1PwvyT44-uE_18-8-rgb_front;142.89;175.59;Now the bass is isolated, but it's reflected back into the area that it came from, because this amount of material is not enough to absorb much bass, 2 inches of fiberglass only absorbs down to about a half an octave below middle C. So a gobo that reflects bass, remember, it keeps the bass inside of the recording space where the bass was coming from, so it causes more bass to be inside the gobo space.;8;77
9587;1PwvyT44-uE;1PwvyT44-uE-8-rgb_front;1PwvyT44-uE_19;1PwvyT44-uE_19-8-rgb_front;176.24;176.49;Okay.;8;1
9588;1PwvyT44-uE;1PwvyT44-uE-8-rgb_front;1PwvyT44-uE_2;1PwvyT44-uE_2-8-rgb_front;8.14;11.81;Now the purpose of this barrier is to be inside of a home studio.;8;14
9589;1PwvyT44-uE;1PwvyT44-uE-8-rgb_front;1PwvyT44-uE_20;1PwvyT44-uE_20-8-rgb_front;176.9;182.51;This is an interesting version, this is more of a finished product, but it's a form of a gobo.;8;19
9590;1PwvyT44-uE;1PwvyT44-uE-8-rgb_front;1PwvyT44-uE_21;1PwvyT44-uE_21-8-rgb_front;183.46;188.6;A hard heavy interior core, but with absorption on both sides.;8;11
9591;1PwvyT44-uE;1PwvyT44-uE-8-rgb_front;1PwvyT44-uE_22;1PwvyT44-uE_22-8-rgb_front;188.89;197.33;Now you have an instrument here, and an instrument here, you've got a bass barrier between the instruments, and you have a treble range absorber on either side.;8;28
9592;1PwvyT44-uE;1PwvyT44-uE-8-rgb_front;1PwvyT44-uE_23_24;1PwvyT44-uE_23_24-8-rgb_front;197.92;233.71;So that is the typical gobo assembly. And in our case, we take a piece of 2 by 4, we make a little notch here, and a little notch here, take a piece of medite, or we can take a piece of hardy board, or backer board, glue it into the notch, and you have a frame with a bass barrier in the middle that's holding it all together, and then you have absorption on either side of it, and then cover it with fabric, staple the fabric on, and you're done.;8;92
9593;1PwvyT44-uE;1PwvyT44-uE-8-rgb_front;1PwvyT44-uE_3;1PwvyT44-uE_3-8-rgb_front;12.41;31.44;And now the second purpose of a barrier is usually to separate one instrument from another instrument, so that the mics associated with recording one instrument aren't picking up bleed from the next door neighbor, these are typically called gobos.;8;40
9594;1PwvyT44-uE;1PwvyT44-uE-8-rgb_front;1PwvyT44-uE_4;1PwvyT44-uE_4-8-rgb_front;32.15;42.03;And so now, a gobo is, there's different kinds of gobos, and so the first and most common one would be a sound absorbing gobo.;8;25
9595;1PwvyT44-uE;1PwvyT44-uE-8-rgb_front;1PwvyT44-uE_5;1PwvyT44-uE_5-8-rgb_front;42.38;45.3;So this is 2 inch air conditioning duct board.;8;9

9643;1Q2BYTlbdiE;1Q2BYTlbdiE-8-rgb_front;1Q2BYTlbdiE_24;1Q2BYTlbdiE_24-8-rgb_front;69.31;71.44;Now she's going to step forward, her left foot.;8;9

9659;1Q7oQwL6QaQ;1Q7oQwL6QaQ-8-rgb_front;1Q7oQwL6QaQ_1;1Q7oQwL6QaQ_1-8-rgb_front;7.64;16.61;Today we're going to have some fun talking about some antique-like, types of things, collectibles mostly that, that you can still buy that are sleepers, that are imports.;8;28

9663;1Q7oQwL6QaQ;1Q7oQwL6QaQ-8-rgb_front;1Q7oQwL6QaQ_13;1Q7oQwL6QaQ_13-8-rgb_front;76.02;76.76;Should I buy it?;8;4

9665;1Q7oQwL6QaQ;1Q7oQwL6QaQ-8-rgb_front;1Q7oQwL6QaQ_2;1Q7oQwL6QaQ_2-8-rgb_front;17.11;21.27;These imports are going to be really exciting but before I talk about those, let me talk about me, for a minute.;8;22
9666;1Q7oQwL6QaQ;1Q7oQwL6QaQ-8-rgb_front;1Q7oQwL6QaQ_3;1Q7oQwL6QaQ_3-8-rgb_front;21.88;22.8;Let?s make it about me.;8;5
9667;1Q7oQwL6QaQ;1Q7oQwL6QaQ-8-rgb_front;1Q7oQwL6QaQ_4;1Q7oQwL6QaQ_4-8-rgb_front;23.49;27.85;Like I said, my name is Jan and I have an antique store in Pomona, it's called Antique Avenue.;8;19
9668;1Q7oQwL6QaQ;1Q7oQwL6QaQ-8-rgb_front;1Q7oQwL6QaQ_5;1Q7oQwL6QaQ_5-8-rgb_front;28.07;38.33;I used to be a College Administrator but I hated it, boring, so I decided to become an antique appraiser, which is a heck of a lot more fun and it's more relevant, if you ask me.;8;37
9669;1Q7oQwL6QaQ;1Q7oQwL6QaQ-8-rgb_front;1Q7oQwL6QaQ_6;1Q7oQwL6QaQ_6-8-rgb_front;38.78;44.36;So I decided to be an antique appraiser and I opened my shop, in Pomona and so you can come anytime.;8;21
9670;1Q7oQwL6QaQ;1Q7oQwL6QaQ-8-rgb_front;1Q7oQwL6QaQ_7;1Q7oQwL6QaQ_7-8-rgb_front;44.53;47.85;Bring your trash or treasure and we'll take a look at it for you.;8;14

9672;1Q7oQwL6QaQ;1Q7oQwL6QaQ-8-rgb_front;1Q7oQwL6QaQ_9;1Q7oQwL6QaQ_9-8-rgb_front;53.79;58.17;So today, like I said, we're going to be talking about imports and we're going to focus on Japan.;8;19
9673;1QBezkHsXd4;1QBezkHsXd4-8-rgb_front;1QBezkHsXd4_0;1QBezkHsXd4_0-8-rgb_front;0.74;7.43;Although you may compete in some triathlons, especially in the spring that have pool swims, a true triathlon takes an open water swim.;8;23
9674;1QBezkHsXd4;1QBezkHsXd4-8-rgb_front;1QBezkHsXd4_1;1QBezkHsXd4_1-8-rgb_front;7.43;10.83;And there are some special considerations when competing in an open water swim.;8;13
9675;1QBezkHsXd4;1QBezkHsXd4-8-rgb_front;1QBezkHsXd4_10;1QBezkHsXd4_10-8-rgb_front;47.18;51.35;The poorer swimmer you are, the more you'll gain time with the wet suit.;8;14
9676;1QBezkHsXd4;1QBezkHsXd4-8-rgb_front;1QBezkHsXd4_11;1QBezkHsXd4_11-8-rgb_front;51.7;59.48;If you have really good body position already, the wet suit won't pick up a lot of time but most people will see a three to five second per hundred improvement and that's a really nice thing.;8;37
9677;1QBezkHsXd4;1QBezkHsXd4-8-rgb_front;1QBezkHsXd4_12;1QBezkHsXd4_12-8-rgb_front;59.72;66.05;Another nice thing, of course is that you're going to be able to wear what you're going to run and bike in underneath the wet suit and then just peel it off and be ready to go.;8;37
9678;1QBezkHsXd4;1QBezkHsXd4-8-rgb_front;1QBezkHsXd4_13;1QBezkHsXd4_13-8-rgb_front;66.32;70.7;So even though you're going to lose a bit of time taking a wet suit off, you gain it by having that gear on underneath.;8;25
9679;1QBezkHsXd4;1QBezkHsXd4-8-rgb_front;1QBezkHsXd4_14;1QBezkHsXd4_14-8-rgb_front;71.19;77.86;Some other specifics when you think about open water swimming is you need to get used to starting fast.;8;19
9680;1QBezkHsXd4;1QBezkHsXd4-8-rgb_front;1QBezkHsXd4_15;1QBezkHsXd4_15-8-rgb_front;78.73;82.31;It's real easy to get lulled into the group your with.;8;11
9681;1QBezkHsXd4;1QBezkHsXd4-8-rgb_front;1QBezkHsXd4_16;1QBezkHsXd4_16-8-rgb_front;82.31;92.56;So you want to get off the line quick and you could practice that in swimming by doing some fast fifties right before you do your long sets or something like that to get out and then quickly settle into your rhythm.;8;42
9682;1QBezkHsXd4;1QBezkHsXd4-8-rgb_front;1QBezkHsXd4_17_18;1QBezkHsXd4_17_18-8-rgb_front;92.85;103.22;You don't want to just kind of ease into the thing you get into a slow group. If you have the opportunity to go to a lake to swim with a little triathlon club or something like that to practice open water swimming, it's a great thing to do.;8;49
9683;1QBezkHsXd4;1QBezkHsXd4-8-rgb_front;1QBezkHsXd4_19;1QBezkHsXd4_19-8-rgb_front;103.51;112.67;You could practice drafting off somebody, what it's like to swim right close behind and again that's just best experienced by doing it.;8;23
9684;1QBezkHsXd4;1QBezkHsXd4-8-rgb_front;1QBezkHsXd4_2;1QBezkHsXd4_2-8-rgb_front;11.15;16.41;Some of them you can address in training and some of them really just need to be addressed by the experience of doing the races.;8;25
9685;1QBezkHsXd4;1QBezkHsXd4-8-rgb_front;1QBezkHsXd4_20;1QBezkHsXd4_20-8-rgb_front;113.39;115.64;Some other things you can practice in the pool, sighting.;8;10
9686;1QBezkHsXd4;1QBezkHsXd4-8-rgb_front;1QBezkHsXd4_21;1QBezkHsXd4_21-8-rgb_front;116.05;122.86;In an open water swim, every six or eight strokes, you need to chop the stroke short and stick your head up.;8;22
9687;1QBezkHsXd4;1QBezkHsXd4-8-rgb_front;1QBezkHsXd4_22;1QBezkHsXd4_22-8-rgb_front;123.19;127.55;Staying on course is a whole other aspect of open water swimming.;8;12
9688;1QBezkHsXd4;1QBezkHsXd4-8-rgb_front;1QBezkHsXd4_23;1QBezkHsXd4_23-8-rgb_front;127.82;140.54;So try to pick something on the shore line, not the buoy that you're swimming for, but a boat ramp or a home or lamp pole or something so that if you've got a sea of bright orange caps in front of you, that you still know what you're swimming for.;8;51
9689;1QBezkHsXd4;1QBezkHsXd4-8-rgb_front;1QBezkHsXd4_24;1QBezkHsXd4_24-8-rgb_front;141.05;145.38;So those are some real key and specific things for when you tackle that open water swim.;8;17
9690;1QBezkHsXd4;1QBezkHsXd4-8-rgb_front;1QBezkHsXd4_3;1QBezkHsXd4_3-8-rgb_front;16.7;26.2;One of the most basic tips: put on your goggles, then put the cap on over top of the goggles and that way, if you collide with somebody and their hand drags along your head, it won't rip your goggles off.;8;41
9691;1QBezkHsXd4;1QBezkHsXd4-8-rgb_front;1QBezkHsXd4_4;1QBezkHsXd4_4-8-rgb_front;27.01;29.43;You need to practice swimming in your wet suit.;8;9
9692;1QBezkHsXd4;1QBezkHsXd4-8-rgb_front;1QBezkHsXd4_5;1QBezkHsXd4_5-8-rgb_front;29.79;33.83;Swimming in a wet suit is completely different than swimming without one.;8;12
9693;1QBezkHsXd4;1QBezkHsXd4-8-rgb_front;1QBezkHsXd4_6;1QBezkHsXd4_6-8-rgb_front;34.11;40.05;You'll probably use one to two strokes less per length, you'll glide more and you'll ride higher in the water.;8;20
9694;1QBezkHsXd4;1QBezkHsXd4-8-rgb_front;1QBezkHsXd4_7;1QBezkHsXd4_7-8-rgb_front;40.27;44.94;So, you can take it into the pool and swim a bit in it just to get accustomed to it.;8;20
9695;1QBezkHsXd4;1QBezkHsXd4-8-rgb_front;1QBezkHsXd4_8;1QBezkHsXd4_8-8-rgb_front;44.94;45.95;It feels very different.;8;4
9696;1QBezkHsXd4;1QBezkHsXd4-8-rgb_front;1QBezkHsXd4_9;1QBezkHsXd4_9-8-rgb_front;46.15;47.13;It's very efficient.;8;3
9722;1QJtPze0F3k;1QJtPze0F3k-8-rgb_front;1QJtPze0F3k_0;1QJtPze0F3k_0-8-rgb_front;0.82;4.02;I'm Dr. Joe Neely I practice with the Barton Oaks Dental Group.;8;12

9724;1QJtPze0F3k;1QJtPze0F3k-8-rgb_front;1QJtPze0F3k_10;1QJtPze0F3k_10-8-rgb_front;86.95;91.13;So truthfully the smaller the toothbrush usually, the better.;8;9
9725;1QJtPze0F3k;1QJtPze0F3k-8-rgb_front;1QJtPze0F3k_2_3;1QJtPze0F3k_2_3-8-rgb_front;8.69;27.3;Need is definitely necessity is the mother of invention I believe is how that goes. And the toothbrush basically started as a stick that had been chewed on, and the end of the stick became softened and somewhat frayed.;8;39
9726;1QJtPze0F3k;1QJtPze0F3k-8-rgb_front;1QJtPze0F3k_4;1QJtPze0F3k_4-8-rgb_front;27.8;31.86;And the stick was used to basically go across and scrape your teeth.;8;13
9727;1QJtPze0F3k;1QJtPze0F3k-8-rgb_front;1QJtPze0F3k_5;1QJtPze0F3k_5-8-rgb_front;32.7;46.68;Early on there was also the use of bone, there are actually bone things that had been found by archaeologist that look to resemble toothpicks.;8;25
9728;1QJtPze0F3k;1QJtPze0F3k-8-rgb_front;1QJtPze0F3k_6;1QJtPze0F3k_6-8-rgb_front;47.46;53.86;Because of the essence stuck in between your teeth you need something slender to slide in there and push it out.;8;21
9729;1QJtPze0F3k;1QJtPze0F3k-8-rgb_front;1QJtPze0F3k_7;1QJtPze0F3k_7-8-rgb_front;53.86;65.36;Over time like any cleaning aid, people who were merchants found new ways to make them more efficient.;8;18

9731;1QJtPze0F3k;1QJtPze0F3k-8-rgb_front;1QJtPze0F3k_9;1QJtPze0F3k_9-8-rgb_front;74.95;86.95;But basically all a toothbrush is, is a cleaning tool that's of the appropriate size and shape to clean the object that you're trying to clean.;8;26
10665;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_0;1Vq_uqeckF8_0-8-rgb_front;0.41;3.11;Okay, in this clip, we're going to, I'm going to show you how to portion the fish.;8;17
10666;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_1;1Vq_uqeckF8_1-8-rgb_front;4.04;4.86;This is a lot of fish.;8;6
10667;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_10;1Vq_uqeckF8_10-8-rgb_front;28.04;33.2;So what usually happens is they're going to take a relatively smaller section off the tail.;8;16
10668;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_11;1Vq_uqeckF8_11-8-rgb_front;33.4;37.37;And you're going to get about a six to eight ounce portion maybe is a good serving for someone.;8;19
10669;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_12;1Vq_uqeckF8_12-8-rgb_front;38.12;40.18;And that?s a pretty, pretty uniform thickness.;8;7
10670;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_13;1Vq_uqeckF8_13-8-rgb_front;40.18;42.58;A little tapered off in the tail, but it's a pretty uniform thickness.;8;13
10671;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_14;1Vq_uqeckF8_14-8-rgb_front;42.58;43.47;That will be one serving.;8;5
10672;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_15;1Vq_uqeckF8_15-8-rgb_front;44.05;51.32;What I always like to do is cut down the middle of the fish to basically split the rest of the filet in half.;8;24
10673;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_16;1Vq_uqeckF8_16-8-rgb_front;51.32;53.76;You can see it's pretty thick, there's about a good inch and a half thick.;8;15
10674;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_17;1Vq_uqeckF8_17-8-rgb_front;54.22;66.03;A lot of chefs are going to butterfly this open in some direction where you can still have a thinner piece of fish and they can get more out of their servings that way.;8;34
10675;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_18;1Vq_uqeckF8_18-8-rgb_front;67.11;67.56;Okay.;8;1
10676;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_19;1Vq_uqeckF8_19-8-rgb_front;68.14;70.94;Now, you basically have twice as much fish, half as thick.;8;11
10677;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_2;1Vq_uqeckF8_2-8-rgb_front;4.86;6.85;This filet probably weighs about three pounds.;8;7
10678;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_20;1Vq_uqeckF8_20-8-rgb_front;71.66;75.52;And you know could cut that in half and these would be two more portions.;8;15
10679;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_21;1Vq_uqeckF8_21-8-rgb_front;75.52;79.31;And this is not by any means exactly accurate the way you're going to get it.;8;16
10680;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_22;1Vq_uqeckF8_22-8-rgb_front;79.31;84.89;A thicker filet, once again, I'm going to cut it straight down.;8;12
10681;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_23;1Vq_uqeckF8_23-8-rgb_front;85.22;87.83;Very thick filet, hard to cook evenly.;8;7
10682;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_24;1Vq_uqeckF8_24-8-rgb_front;88.49;102.05;We're going to try to, just cut this butterfly this open to get two filets out of this.;8;18
10683;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_25;1Vq_uqeckF8_25-8-rgb_front;102.05;102.93;Two more filets.;8;3
10684;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_26;1Vq_uqeckF8_26-8-rgb_front;103.94;104.25;Okay?;8;1
10685;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_27;1Vq_uqeckF8_27-8-rgb_front;104.39;105.94;Do the same thing in the head area.;8;8
10686;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_28;1Vq_uqeckF8_28-8-rgb_front;107.22;110.43;And you don't really want to waste anything because this fish is not cheap.;8;14
10687;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_29;1Vq_uqeckF8_29-8-rgb_front;111.52;113.76;Natural resources getting harder and harder to come by.;8;9
10688;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_3;1Vq_uqeckF8_3-8-rgb_front;6.85;7.12;Okay?;8;1
10689;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_30;1Vq_uqeckF8_30-8-rgb_front;114.49;121.24;So, we are going to leave as much fish on here and throw as little away as we can.;8;19
10690;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_31;1Vq_uqeckF8_31-8-rgb_front;121.55;122.71;We want to sell this whole fish.;8;7
10691;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_32;1Vq_uqeckF8_32-8-rgb_front;122.71;123.92;We want to eat this whole fish.;8;7
10692;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_33;1Vq_uqeckF8_33-8-rgb_front;123.92;126.58;And now, we have two more filets.;8;7
10693;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_34;1Vq_uqeckF8_34-8-rgb_front;126.96;132.37;So out of one side, I believe I got six filets, six portions.;8;13
10694;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_4;1Vq_uqeckF8_4-8-rgb_front;7.12;8.44;You can't eat that much fish.;8;6
10695;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_5;1Vq_uqeckF8_5-8-rgb_front;9.6;11.88;One person won't be served this much fish.;8;8
10696;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_6;1Vq_uqeckF8_6-8-rgb_front;11.88;15.77;So we're going to take the fish and we're going to cut it into, what I would consider equal portions.;8;20
10697;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_7;1Vq_uqeckF8_7-8-rgb_front;16.18;19.75;Maybe what a chef would do in a restaurant and that's how they would serve it to you.;8;18
10698;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_8;1Vq_uqeckF8_8-8-rgb_front;20.66;23.58;Okay, the fish is not even as far as thickness.;8;10
10699;1Vq_uqeckF8;1Vq_uqeckF8-8-rgb_front;1Vq_uqeckF8_9;1Vq_uqeckF8_9-8-rgb_front;23.58;27.69;You have got the tail portion, the head portion and you have the thickness mainly in the middle.;8;18
10851;1XVcFJ97QQs;1XVcFJ97QQs-8-rgb_front;1XVcFJ97QQs_1;1XVcFJ97QQs_1-8-rgb_front;4.71;10.18;So the next step is, we're going to come to the ironing board and we're going to mark our side seams.;8;21
10852;1XVcFJ97QQs;1XVcFJ97QQs-8-rgb_front;1XVcFJ97QQs_10;1XVcFJ97QQs_10-8-rgb_front;82.68;88.45;So we're going to roll this direction, towards me so on the finished product you don't have one seam in and one seam out.;8;24
10853;1XVcFJ97QQs;1XVcFJ97QQs-8-rgb_front;1XVcFJ97QQs_2;1XVcFJ97QQs_2-8-rgb_front;10.49;12.49;And so the sides are the short pieces here.;8;9
10854;1XVcFJ97QQs;1XVcFJ97QQs-8-rgb_front;1XVcFJ97QQs_3;1XVcFJ97QQs_3-8-rgb_front;13.02;26.18;We're going to do a nice half inch roll and steaming it so it stays nice and firm because we don't want to have to come back and do that.;8;30
10855;1XVcFJ97QQs;1XVcFJ97QQs-8-rgb_front;1XVcFJ97QQs_4;1XVcFJ97QQs_4-8-rgb_front;26.21;44.39;The steam is going to help set the crease in the fabric so when you sew it you don't have to use pins as much.;8;25
10856;1XVcFJ97QQs;1XVcFJ97QQs-8-rgb_front;1XVcFJ97QQs_5;1XVcFJ97QQs_5-8-rgb_front;44.77;51.51;Okay, once you get the first half inch crease in, you're going to go back to the top, you should always press in the same direction.;8;26
10857;1XVcFJ97QQs;1XVcFJ97QQs-8-rgb_front;1XVcFJ97QQs_6;1XVcFJ97QQs_6-8-rgb_front;51.51;56.85;And when we're pressing, we're actually pressing with the iron not sliding it.;8;13
10858;1XVcFJ97QQs;1XVcFJ97QQs-8-rgb_front;1XVcFJ97QQs_7;1XVcFJ97QQs_7-8-rgb_front;56.88;58.01;I'll show you in just a second.;8;7
10859;1XVcFJ97QQs;1XVcFJ97QQs-8-rgb_front;1XVcFJ97QQs_8;1XVcFJ97QQs_8-8-rgb_front;58.32;62.72;Now we're going to do a second crease and it's going to be a three quarter inch crease.;8;18
10860;1XVcFJ97QQs;1XVcFJ97QQs-8-rgb_front;1XVcFJ97QQs_9;1XVcFJ97QQs_9-8-rgb_front;64.45;82.68;So you're actually wanting to pick the iron up and press down on it, not slide it, and go to the other side and do same thing making sure that you have the rolls going both in the same side.;8;40
10861;1Xj_2_6v1O0;1Xj_2_6v1O0-8-rgb_front;1Xj_2_6v1O0_1;1Xj_2_6v1O0_1-8-rgb_front;4.1;7.31;Today I would be talking about how to tack up a horse.;8;12
10862;1Xj_2_6v1O0;1Xj_2_6v1O0-8-rgb_front;1Xj_2_6v1O0_10;1Xj_2_6v1O0_10-8-rgb_front;83.15;87.39;Once again it is important that the Velcro is pulling towards the back.;8;13
10863;1Xj_2_6v1O0;1Xj_2_6v1O0-8-rgb_front;1Xj_2_6v1O0_11;1Xj_2_6v1O0_11-8-rgb_front;87.59;96.83;Place the cup behind the horses leg, come to the front and then the Velcro pulls towards the back.;8;19
10864;1Xj_2_6v1O0;1Xj_2_6v1O0-8-rgb_front;1Xj_2_6v1O0_2;1Xj_2_6v1O0_2-8-rgb_front;7.31;17.57;So boots are important when you are going to jump your horse or just for basic protection of support.;8;19
10865;1Xj_2_6v1O0;1Xj_2_6v1O0-8-rgb_front;1Xj_2_6v1O0_3;1Xj_2_6v1O0_3-8-rgb_front;17.66;27.86;I especially like to use boots on my horse when they have horse shoes on cause the metal of the shoes can be damaging if they trip or hit themselves on accident.;8;32
10866;1Xj_2_6v1O0;1Xj_2_6v1O0-8-rgb_front;1Xj_2_6v1O0_4;1Xj_2_6v1O0_4-8-rgb_front;28.37;33.05;So we just have 2 basic examples of boots for horses.;8;11
10867;1Xj_2_6v1O0;1Xj_2_6v1O0-8-rgb_front;1Xj_2_6v1O0_5;1Xj_2_6v1O0_5-8-rgb_front;33.4;50.37;These are basic splint boots and you want to make sure that putting the boot on the padded area protects the inside of the horses leg where there are there ligaments are most like to be compromise.;8;37
10868;1Xj_2_6v1O0;1Xj_2_6v1O0-8-rgb_front;1Xj_2_6v1O0_6;1Xj_2_6v1O0_6-8-rgb_front;50.42;59.59;The way that you put the boot on is that the Velcro always comes towards the back and that is how you know you have it on the right leg.;8;30
10869;1Xj_2_6v1O0;1Xj_2_6v1O0-8-rgb_front;1Xj_2_6v1O0_7;1Xj_2_6v1O0_7-8-rgb_front;59.62;65.78;It just comes down to the bottom of the fetlock not pasted the joint where it might interfere.;8;18
10870;1Xj_2_6v1O0;1Xj_2_6v1O0-8-rgb_front;1Xj_2_6v1O0_8;1Xj_2_6v1O0_8-8-rgb_front;65.87;72.81;The second kind of boot is a open front boot.;8;10
10871;1Xj_2_6v1O0;1Xj_2_6v1O0-8-rgb_front;1Xj_2_6v1O0_9;1Xj_2_6v1O0_9-8-rgb_front;73.27;82.27;This protects not only the sides but the back of the horses leg and the fitting is very similar.;8;19
10872;1XoT1-gzWfg;1XoT1-gzWfg-8-rgb_front;1XoT1-gzWfg_0;1XoT1-gzWfg_0-8-rgb_front;1.66;2.19;Hi there.;8;2

10904;1XscSoKf558;1XscSoKf558-8-rgb_front;1XscSoKf558_2;1XscSoKf558_2-8-rgb_front;28.25;48.75;Now it doesn't have to be a perfect shape because the frosting will fill it out and give you the roundness that you want and then when you have it set, you can put a little bit of icing in between as glue and then we'll set that aside until we're ready to use it.;8;55

10920;1XzuqBmJxK4;1XzuqBmJxK4-8-rgb_front;1XzuqBmJxK4_3;1XzuqBmJxK4_3-8-rgb_front;19.79;21.5;As you can see, it's kind of all over the place.;8;11

10923;1XzuqBmJxK4;1XzuqBmJxK4-8-rgb_front;1XzuqBmJxK4_6;1XzuqBmJxK4_6-8-rgb_front;35.59;52.99;Now there's another type of form which we refer to as natural and simplified, and this might be someone who tends to keep the letters separate, keeps the letters separate, and as you can see, it's just very simple.;8;39
10924;1XzuqBmJxK4;1XzuqBmJxK4-8-rgb_front;1XzuqBmJxK4_7;1XzuqBmJxK4_7-8-rgb_front;53.52;56.97;It's a simplified type of writing.;8;6

10929;1Y3Ruxz7AUw;1Y3Ruxz7AUw-8-rgb_front;1Y3Ruxz7AUw_10;1Y3Ruxz7AUw_10-8-rgb_front;76.2;92.89;The one that we like is called Sentinel, and Sentinel is a really great product because it takes care of fleas, intestinal parasites, and also heartworm, and so if you give to your puppy this once a month, it'll prevent your dog from having all of these parasites.;8;48
10930;1Y3Ruxz7AUw;1Y3Ruxz7AUw-8-rgb_front;1Y3Ruxz7AUw_11;1Y3Ruxz7AUw_11-8-rgb_front;93.5;104.05;Now this particular product doesn't do anything for ticks, and so you may have to do some other thing for ticks if you're finding ticks in your neighborhood, or if you take your puppy out on a hike and you come back with ticks.;8;44
10931;1Y3Ruxz7AUw;1Y3Ruxz7AUw-8-rgb_front;1Y3Ruxz7AUw_12;1Y3Ruxz7AUw_12-8-rgb_front;104.8;120.5;Ticks are more common in the wintertime in this area because they need a little bit of moisture, and so if you're starting to pick up some ticks with your dog, you can use a topical product that we can recommend, or we have a really good tick collar that might help your dog from having these attached to him.;8;60
10932;1Y3Ruxz7AUw;1Y3Ruxz7AUw-8-rgb_front;1Y3Ruxz7AUw_2;1Y3Ruxz7AUw_2-8-rgb_front;17.63;27.92;If you get roundworms, these are hookworms, these are whipworms, these are some actually flea eggs that your puppy can get, we're going to talk about that as well.;8;29

10934;1Y3Ruxz7AUw;1Y3Ruxz7AUw-8-rgb_front;1Y3Ruxz7AUw_4;1Y3Ruxz7AUw_4-8-rgb_front;33.72;43.33;That's transmitted by a mosquito and your puppy would not be born with that, but we're going to talk a little bit about products that we might want to use to keep your dog from getting these worms.;8;38
10935;1Y3Ruxz7AUw;1Y3Ruxz7AUw-8-rgb_front;1Y3Ruxz7AUw_5;1Y3Ruxz7AUw_5-8-rgb_front;43.33;48.0;And again roundworms are real common, that they can get passed from their mother.;8;14
10936;1Y3Ruxz7AUw;1Y3Ruxz7AUw-8-rgb_front;1Y3Ruxz7AUw_6;1Y3Ruxz7AUw_6-8-rgb_front;48.0;57.9;In Southern California we don't have a real problem with roundworms after they become adults because they have to pass out of the dog and embryonate for three or four days before they go onto another dog.;8;37
10937;1Y3Ruxz7AUw;1Y3Ruxz7AUw-8-rgb_front;1Y3Ruxz7AUw_7;1Y3Ruxz7AUw_7-8-rgb_front;58.25;61.75;And it's so dry in Southern California that we don't have a big problem with those.;8;16
10938;1Y3Ruxz7AUw;1Y3Ruxz7AUw-8-rgb_front;1Y3Ruxz7AUw_8;1Y3Ruxz7AUw_8-8-rgb_front;62.3;66.5;We're seeing more and more problems with heartworm, however, and it's spreading all over the nation.;8;16

10943;1Y3zGxJShdA;1Y3zGxJShdA-8-rgb_front;1Y3zGxJShdA_4;1Y3zGxJShdA_4-8-rgb_front;32.41;46.3;As you can see, that has taken that down and it will have a nice finished appearance on that edge.;8;20
10944;1Y3zGxJShdA;1Y3zGxJShdA-8-rgb_front;1Y3zGxJShdA_5;1Y3zGxJShdA_5-8-rgb_front;46.81;53.9;For a rounded edge, we are going to make a series of cuts turning the planer as we go.;8;19
10945;1Y3zGxJShdA;1Y3zGxJShdA-8-rgb_front;1Y3zGxJShdA_6;1Y3zGxJShdA_6-8-rgb_front;54.26;57.28;This is going to start to create that radius.;8;9

10947;1YAa5_d-zg0;1YAa5_d-zg0-8-rgb_front;1YAa5_d-zg0_0;1YAa5_d-zg0_0-8-rgb_front;0.16;12.67;Okay, in this clip we're going to be drawing hair on our queen, and what we'll do is we'll start kind of like right along the edges here, and she, her hair is going to be very interesting.;8;38

10952;1YAa5_d-zg0;1YAa5_d-zg0-8-rgb_front;1YAa5_d-zg0_13;1YAa5_d-zg0_13-8-rgb_front;151.56;158.2;You want people to clearly see that that is a feather on top of our good queen's head.;8;18

10965;1YKBEpMNuWE;1YKBEpMNuWE-8-rgb_front;1YKBEpMNuWE_0;1YKBEpMNuWE_0-8-rgb_front;1.22;15.82;Some of the common mistakes you may experience while learning how to do a nollie lipslide is basically getting into it and making sure that your back wheels clear the obstacle because they have to get all the way above it before you can lipslide.;8;45
10966;1YKBEpMNuWE;1YKBEpMNuWE-8-rgb_front;1YKBEpMNuWE_1;1YKBEpMNuWE_1-8-rgb_front;16.62;21.25;So remember you are going to want to nollie and get over the obstacle and come down into it.;8;19
10967;1YKBEpMNuWE;1YKBEpMNuWE-8-rgb_front;1YKBEpMNuWE_2;1YKBEpMNuWE_2-8-rgb_front;21.55;27.04;You don't want to hit it on the way up so you want to make sure that your nollie is high enough to get into lipslide.;8;26
10968;1YKBEpMNuWE;1YKBEpMNuWE-8-rgb_front;1YKBEpMNuWE_3;1YKBEpMNuWE_3-8-rgb_front;27.87;42.3;The other common mistake people make is that once you are sliding on the bar, the bar is just a small obstacle so it is really slick against your board, So a lot of times people find that they land on the lipslide and it shoots out.;8;47

11067;1Yp-xuljnDM;1Yp-xuljnDM-8-rgb_front;1Yp-xuljnDM_6;1Yp-xuljnDM_6-8-rgb_front;18.4;19.95;Now I'm in a nice warrior stance.;8;7
11068;1Yp-xuljnDM;1Yp-xuljnDM-8-rgb_front;1Yp-xuljnDM_7;1Yp-xuljnDM_7-8-rgb_front;20.14;25.45;I'm going to slightly slide my opposite leg back so I have some nice steadiness there.;8;16
11069;1Yp-xuljnDM;1Yp-xuljnDM-8-rgb_front;1Yp-xuljnDM_8;1Yp-xuljnDM_8-8-rgb_front;25.68;29.41;I'm going to sweep down, grab a hold of this hand place it behind the head.;8;16
11070;1Yp-xuljnDM;1Yp-xuljnDM-8-rgb_front;1Yp-xuljnDM_9;1Yp-xuljnDM_9-8-rgb_front;29.74;31.78;Sweep down, bring it back.;8;5
11071;1Z4f7kN6yWY;1Z4f7kN6yWY-8-rgb_front;1Z4f7kN6yWY_0;1Z4f7kN6yWY_0-8-rgb_front;0.22;4.52;So now I've completed my scoring on the top ring and the bottom ring.;8;14
11072;1Z4f7kN6yWY;1Z4f7kN6yWY-8-rgb_front;1Z4f7kN6yWY_1;1Z4f7kN6yWY_1-8-rgb_front;4.98;18.95;The next thing I'm going to do is take a paint brush, you could do this with your finger or sponge, and simply go all the way around and put slip all over my scored area, like this.;8;38
11073;1Z4f7kN6yWY;1Z4f7kN6yWY-8-rgb_front;1Z4f7kN6yWY_10;1Z4f7kN6yWY_10-8-rgb_front;81.74;87.37;I like to just simply use a wet a wooden spoon like this, wet it down and put it on the inside.;8;22
11074;1Z4f7kN6yWY;1Z4f7kN6yWY-8-rgb_front;1Z4f7kN6yWY_11;1Z4f7kN6yWY_11-8-rgb_front;87.37;93.64;And I'm going to use this as a support to push down the top part onto the bottom part.;8;19
11075;1Z4f7kN6yWY;1Z4f7kN6yWY-8-rgb_front;1Z4f7kN6yWY_12;1Z4f7kN6yWY_12-8-rgb_front;94.04;103.67;I'm going to stick my spoon inside and then move the wheel around and apply quite a lot of force onto the base there.;8;24
11076;1Z4f7kN6yWY;1Z4f7kN6yWY-8-rgb_front;1Z4f7kN6yWY_13;1Z4f7kN6yWY_13-8-rgb_front;105.57;108.59;So that the two parts become one.;8;7
11077;1Z4f7kN6yWY;1Z4f7kN6yWY-8-rgb_front;1Z4f7kN6yWY_14;1Z4f7kN6yWY_14-8-rgb_front;109.77;120.34;Again, holding this on the underside there, you can see that edge is being used, and pushing it up underneath, and pushing my finger down on the top to ensure a nice connection.;8;33
11078;1Z4f7kN6yWY;1Z4f7kN6yWY-8-rgb_front;1Z4f7kN6yWY_15;1Z4f7kN6yWY_15-8-rgb_front;124.35;126.81;I'm actually applying more pressure than what it may look like.;8;11
11079;1Z4f7kN6yWY;1Z4f7kN6yWY-8-rgb_front;1Z4f7kN6yWY_16;1Z4f7kN6yWY_16-8-rgb_front;127.87;132.96;Straight down you can actually see the clay working down into the body of the other part.;8;17
11080;1Z4f7kN6yWY;1Z4f7kN6yWY-8-rgb_front;1Z4f7kN6yWY_17;1Z4f7kN6yWY_17-8-rgb_front;139.45;150.32;Okay so now I've pushed the top part down onto the bottom part, the slip is there, I might want to take some extra slip afterwards and just simply go around the edge there.;8;34
11081;1Z4f7kN6yWY;1Z4f7kN6yWY-8-rgb_front;1Z4f7kN6yWY_18;1Z4f7kN6yWY_18-8-rgb_front;151.27;157.08;Then I can go over and take out any grooves that I might have put into the clay, like so.;8;20
11082;1Z4f7kN6yWY;1Z4f7kN6yWY-8-rgb_front;1Z4f7kN6yWY_19;1Z4f7kN6yWY_19-8-rgb_front;160.75;166.27;Perhaps take a sponge just to wipe everything down at the end, like that.;8;14
11083;1Z4f7kN6yWY;1Z4f7kN6yWY-8-rgb_front;1Z4f7kN6yWY_2;1Z4f7kN6yWY_2-8-rgb_front;19.38;27.26;I'm going to repeat the same process here, working my way all the way around giving lots of slip on there, like that.;8;23
11084;1Z4f7kN6yWY;1Z4f7kN6yWY-8-rgb_front;1Z4f7kN6yWY_20;1Z4f7kN6yWY_20-8-rgb_front;169.68;174.17;Any slur that might have gotten on there, take it off.;8;11
11085;1Z4f7kN6yWY;1Z4f7kN6yWY-8-rgb_front;1Z4f7kN6yWY_21;1Z4f7kN6yWY_21-8-rgb_front;174.35;180.96;Okay, so as you can see we have now completed the throwing and assembly of our two part vase.;8;19
11086;1Z4f7kN6yWY;1Z4f7kN6yWY-8-rgb_front;1Z4f7kN6yWY_22;1Z4f7kN6yWY_22-8-rgb_front;180.96;188.85;In the next section I will just be talking briefly about tips on finishing this up, and getting it ready for the kiln.;8;23
11087;1Z4f7kN6yWY;1Z4f7kN6yWY-8-rgb_front;1Z4f7kN6yWY_23;1Z4f7kN6yWY_23-8-rgb_front;189.23;191.09;And we'll be talking about that next.;8;7
11088;1Z4f7kN6yWY;1Z4f7kN6yWY-8-rgb_front;1Z4f7kN6yWY_3;1Z4f7kN6yWY_3-8-rgb_front;29.94;36.59;Okay, so now I've completed slipping my pot and as you can see I have a nice thick layer on the top and the bottom.;8;25
11089;1Z4f7kN6yWY;1Z4f7kN6yWY-8-rgb_front;1Z4f7kN6yWY_4;1Z4f7kN6yWY_4-8-rgb_front;37.43;46.53;When doing a two part vase like this you might want to then turn the wheel and simply make some circular marks to let you know where to put it on.;8;31
11090;1Z4f7kN6yWY;1Z4f7kN6yWY-8-rgb_front;1Z4f7kN6yWY_5;1Z4f7kN6yWY_5-8-rgb_front;46.78;49.78;We can get rid of these afterwards, these marks.;8;9
11091;1Z4f7kN6yWY;1Z4f7kN6yWY-8-rgb_front;1Z4f7kN6yWY_6;1Z4f7kN6yWY_6-8-rgb_front;50.68;53.21;So now we have an idea of where we want to stick the top.;8;14
11092;1Z4f7kN6yWY;1Z4f7kN6yWY-8-rgb_front;1Z4f7kN6yWY_7;1Z4f7kN6yWY_7-8-rgb_front;54.31;66.87;Now we're going to take this top, turn it over, simply place it on to one of our rings, like so, maybe turn the wheel see how centered it is.;8;30
11093;1Z4f7kN6yWY;1Z4f7kN6yWY-8-rgb_front;1Z4f7kN6yWY_8;1Z4f7kN6yWY_8-8-rgb_front;68.06;76.85;You could repeat the centering process with a needle tool to get this absolutely and correctly in place, however that looks pretty good.;8;23
11094;1Z4f7kN6yWY;1Z4f7kN6yWY-8-rgb_front;1Z4f7kN6yWY_9;1Z4f7kN6yWY_9-8-rgb_front;77.2;81.74;So now what I'm going to want to do, they make a variety of tools to go inside.;8;18
11121;1ZReTq9V2RI;1ZReTq9V2RI-8-rgb_front;1ZReTq9V2RI_1;1ZReTq9V2RI_1-8-rgb_front;4.85;8.84;In this video clip we'll be calculating the area of a circle.;8;12
11122;1ZReTq9V2RI;1ZReTq9V2RI-8-rgb_front;1ZReTq9V2RI_2;1ZReTq9V2RI_2-8-rgb_front;9.55;19.16;On this end table we're going to be putting a custom covering on the top and we need to figure out how much area this circle is.;8;27
11123;1ZReTq9V2RI;1ZReTq9V2RI-8-rgb_front;1ZReTq9V2RI_3;1ZReTq9V2RI_3-8-rgb_front;19.6;31.39;"The first thing we need to do is find the diameter of the circle, here we have the diameter of about 16"" and we're actually looking for the radius.";8;29
11124;1ZReTq9V2RI;1ZReTq9V2RI-8-rgb_front;1ZReTq9V2RI_4;1ZReTq9V2RI_4-8-rgb_front;31.39;36.31;"So we're going to take 8"" which is half of the diameter.";8;12
11125;1ZReTq9V2RI;1ZReTq9V2RI-8-rgb_front;1ZReTq9V2RI_5;1ZReTq9V2RI_5-8-rgb_front;36.95;56.52;What we're going to do from here is take a pie times the radius square so it'll be 3.1416 X 8 X 8 and that's going to give us a total area of 201.05 square inches of that circular top.;8;40
11126;1ZU0GLcgAjQ;1ZU0GLcgAjQ-8-rgb_front;1ZU0GLcgAjQ_0;1ZU0GLcgAjQ_0-8-rgb_front;0.46;6.41;This is Anthony and we are going to talk today about tabletop photography, lighting tips.;8;15

11128;1ZU0GLcgAjQ;1ZU0GLcgAjQ-8-rgb_front;1ZU0GLcgAjQ_2;1ZU0GLcgAjQ_2-8-rgb_front;14.98;33.14;Soft boxes are strobe units that have big white cloth box around them and I point them at 90 degree angles at my tabletop or some kind of angle and make the lighting interesting so that is one of the first lighting elements I like to use for tabletop photography.;8;50
11129;1ZU0GLcgAjQ;1ZU0GLcgAjQ-8-rgb_front;1ZU0GLcgAjQ_3;1ZU0GLcgAjQ_3-8-rgb_front;33.67;38.93;Also Iike to use natural light when I can if I have a diffused window pointed at my tabletop.;8;19
11130;1ZU0GLcgAjQ;1ZU0GLcgAjQ-8-rgb_front;1ZU0GLcgAjQ_4;1ZU0GLcgAjQ_4-8-rgb_front;39.43;45.19;Now that is not always possible in the studio so I really enjoy using the soft boxes.;8;17
11131;1ZU0GLcgAjQ;1ZU0GLcgAjQ-8-rgb_front;1ZU0GLcgAjQ_5;1ZU0GLcgAjQ_5-8-rgb_front;45.19;59.17;The other type of lighting that I like to use is an underlight I call it and that is a tabletop that I can see through and I have a light that will come up from the bottom and again it really depends on what I am photographing.;8;48
11132;1ZU0GLcgAjQ;1ZU0GLcgAjQ-8-rgb_front;1ZU0GLcgAjQ_6;1ZU0GLcgAjQ_6-8-rgb_front;59.56;73.35;Sometimes I will be photographing different types of scientific things that really need to look almost translucent where I c an almost build a layer of different types of whatever I am photographing so that back light or bottom light as I like to call it is very helpful.;8;49
11133;1ZU0GLcgAjQ;1ZU0GLcgAjQ-8-rgb_front;1ZU0GLcgAjQ_7_8;1ZU0GLcgAjQ_7_8-8-rgb_front;73.81;102.0;The other type of lighting or part of my lighting set up that I like to use is a monitor. When I am shooting digitally which is almost 90% of the time in my tabletop photography the image that I shoot transfers right away to my monitor and I have a very big monitor so I can instantly see what my lighting looks like and it helps me adjusting and tweak and make my product or whatever I am photographing on the tabletop look the way I want it to look and those are some great tips on how to light tabletop photography.;8;103

11137;1ZWGv-_yKrU;1ZWGv-_yKrU-8-rgb_front;1ZWGv-_yKrU_12;1ZWGv-_yKrU_12-8-rgb_front;65.09;69.71;Otherwise I end up straining my wrist and it's a sure thing that I'll end up losing the match.;8;19

11147;1Zk7y3MjuU4;1Zk7y3MjuU4-8-rgb_front;1Zk7y3MjuU4_1;1Zk7y3MjuU4_1-8-rgb_front;14.4;18.73;It also helps make the dome smoother when you torch it.;8;11

11150;1Zk7y3MjuU4;1Zk7y3MjuU4-8-rgb_front;1Zk7y3MjuU4_3;1Zk7y3MjuU4_3-8-rgb_front;35.35;40.73;So you want to turn this kind of slowly and hold the torch against the pot.;8;16

11153;1Zk7y3MjuU4;1Zk7y3MjuU4-8-rgb_front;1Zk7y3MjuU4_6;1Zk7y3MjuU4_6-8-rgb_front;48.63;66.48;The other thing it is going to do is the heat is going to expand the air on the inside of this dome and it is going to cause a little bit of pressure that is going to push against the walls of the dome so when we go back with our rib to smooth it that will actually help us out a lot to keep the dome from collapsing.;8;70
11154;1Zk7y3MjuU4;1Zk7y3MjuU4-8-rgb_front;1Zk7y3MjuU4_7;1Zk7y3MjuU4_7-8-rgb_front;66.48;76.94;Now you don't want to keep the torch in one place for too very long.;8;15
11155;1Zk7y3MjuU4;1Zk7y3MjuU4-8-rgb_front;1Zk7y3MjuU4_8;1Zk7y3MjuU4_8-8-rgb_front;76.94;84.12;It is important to keep it moving so that you don't get any of the clay too hard, you can make it crack.;8;23
11156;1Zk7y3MjuU4;1Zk7y3MjuU4-8-rgb_front;1Zk7y3MjuU4_9;1Zk7y3MjuU4_9-8-rgb_front;84.15;111.32;And now that you have got it just a little bit firmer and drier turn off your torch, take your rib and smooth the dome out a little bit more.;8;30
11157;1ZwEJcdFUSM;1ZwEJcdFUSM-8-rgb_front;1ZwEJcdFUSM_0;1ZwEJcdFUSM_0-8-rgb_front;0.59;5.42;We're going to add one more element to our Egyptian Walk, circling with it.;8;14
11158;1ZwEJcdFUSM;1ZwEJcdFUSM-8-rgb_front;1ZwEJcdFUSM_1;1ZwEJcdFUSM_1-8-rgb_front;5.75;9.17;So as we travel, we're going to think about angling our body.;8;12
11159;1ZwEJcdFUSM;1ZwEJcdFUSM-8-rgb_front;1ZwEJcdFUSM_10;1ZwEJcdFUSM_10-8-rgb_front;44.64;49.35;And again here, it will be angled slightly, step and here, step.;8;12
11160;1ZwEJcdFUSM;1ZwEJcdFUSM-8-rgb_front;1ZwEJcdFUSM_11;1ZwEJcdFUSM_11-8-rgb_front;49.35;54.25;Let's try it again, with just plain Ibis arms, you can always vary, vary, put variations on the arms.;8;19
11161;1ZwEJcdFUSM;1ZwEJcdFUSM-8-rgb_front;1ZwEJcdFUSM_12;1ZwEJcdFUSM_12-8-rgb_front;54.55;64.99;"Turning the left; step, up, shoulders are square to the wall, step, and step.";8;14
11162;1ZwEJcdFUSM;1ZwEJcdFUSM-8-rgb_front;1ZwEJcdFUSM_13;1ZwEJcdFUSM_13-8-rgb_front;64.99;65.18;Good.;8;1
11163;1ZwEJcdFUSM;1ZwEJcdFUSM-8-rgb_front;1ZwEJcdFUSM_2;1ZwEJcdFUSM_2-8-rgb_front;9.17;15.38;So we still want to be square on with whoever we're facing, but we're going to angle the lower body, upper body stays square.;8;24
11164;1ZwEJcdFUSM;1ZwEJcdFUSM-8-rgb_front;1ZwEJcdFUSM_3;1ZwEJcdFUSM_3-8-rgb_front;15.74;20.21;"So, it's going to be; step, twist, a little bit of twist with the lower body.";8;16
11165;1ZwEJcdFUSM;1ZwEJcdFUSM-8-rgb_front;1ZwEJcdFUSM_4;1ZwEJcdFUSM_4-8-rgb_front;20.32;23.42;But the hip is still going straight up into the rib cage.;8;12
11166;1ZwEJcdFUSM;1ZwEJcdFUSM-8-rgb_front;1ZwEJcdFUSM_5;1ZwEJcdFUSM_5-8-rgb_front;23.42;31.94;Step and twist, again, step, and step, twist, step, lower body.;8;11
11167;1ZwEJcdFUSM;1ZwEJcdFUSM-8-rgb_front;1ZwEJcdFUSM_6;1ZwEJcdFUSM_6-8-rgb_front;32.63;35.78;So what that means is that your feet aren't going to be square on to the wall.;8;17
11168;1ZwEJcdFUSM;1ZwEJcdFUSM-8-rgb_front;1ZwEJcdFUSM_7;1ZwEJcdFUSM_7-8-rgb_front;35.9;37.47;Theyâre going to be angled slightly.;8;6
11169;1ZwEJcdFUSM;1ZwEJcdFUSM-8-rgb_front;1ZwEJcdFUSM_8;1ZwEJcdFUSM_8-8-rgb_front;38.19;38.47;Okay.;8;1
11170;1ZwEJcdFUSM;1ZwEJcdFUSM-8-rgb_front;1ZwEJcdFUSM_9;1ZwEJcdFUSM_9-8-rgb_front;38.47;44.29;So then as you turn, you're going to angle slightly from the direct line here.;8;15
11171;1_04cx7YyTg;1_04cx7YyTg-8-rgb_front;1_04cx7YyTg_0;1_04cx7YyTg_0-8-rgb_front;0.84;4.07;Now I'm going to show you some things about bent water keys.;8;12
11172;1_04cx7YyTg;1_04cx7YyTg-8-rgb_front;1_04cx7YyTg_1;1_04cx7YyTg_1-8-rgb_front;4.4;18.36;This one here is bent and it is hitting the slide tube which is not a good thing, because you can about imagine, over time it's going to make a little dent in your slide which will make the slide not properly work.;8;43
11173;1_04cx7YyTg;1_04cx7YyTg-8-rgb_front;1_04cx7YyTg_2;1_04cx7YyTg_2-8-rgb_front;18.72;30.56;So we'll take our little round nose pliers and, this one doesn't need to be moved too much, and if you feel a little squeamish about doing this, go ahead and just take it to your local repair facility.;8;39
11174;1_04cx7YyTg;1_04cx7YyTg-8-rgb_front;1_04cx7YyTg_3;1_04cx7YyTg_3-8-rgb_front;30.56;42.92;I'm using my thumb as well as the pliers for a little bit of leverage, and we just want to move that over just a little bit to get it into the proper position.;8;34
11175;1_04cx7YyTg;1_04cx7YyTg-8-rgb_front;1_04cx7YyTg_4;1_04cx7YyTg_4-8-rgb_front;43.35;57.18;And if this is not, if this is bent, the key part that covers your water key hole, if that is bent then your slide will leak, you won't play properly.;8;31
11176;1_04cx7YyTg;1_04cx7YyTg-8-rgb_front;1_04cx7YyTg_5;1_04cx7YyTg_5-8-rgb_front;57.22;61.38;So it's very imperative that your water key works properly on your trombone.;8;13
11177;1_04cx7YyTg;1_04cx7YyTg-8-rgb_front;1_04cx7YyTg_6;1_04cx7YyTg_6-8-rgb_front;61.84;64.7;And that is how to properly repair a bent water key.;8;11
11178;1_7KwjlgBVw;1_7KwjlgBVw-8-rgb_front;1_7KwjlgBVw_0;1_7KwjlgBVw_0-8-rgb_front;0.39;11.85;So once we're in our split position it's very beneficial to try and bend forward with that, which will then stretch all of the muscles along the front of the leg.;8;31
11179;1_7KwjlgBVw;1_7KwjlgBVw-8-rgb_front;1_7KwjlgBVw_1;1_7KwjlgBVw_1-8-rgb_front;12.51;25.45;Now, it's very challenging to do this sometimes, so all we're going to try and do to begin with, is to walk the hands slightly forward, and extend them out as far as they can go.;8;36
11180;1_7KwjlgBVw;1_7KwjlgBVw-8-rgb_front;1_7KwjlgBVw_2;1_7KwjlgBVw_2-8-rgb_front;25.86;29.09;And from this position, just hold that position and breathe.;8;10
11181;1_7KwjlgBVw;1_7KwjlgBVw-8-rgb_front;1_7KwjlgBVw_3;1_7KwjlgBVw_3-8-rgb_front;35.38;43.43;Whatever position we get our bodies into, if we can hold the position and breathe, we give the muscles a chance to relax.;8;23
11182;1_7KwjlgBVw;1_7KwjlgBVw-8-rgb_front;1_7KwjlgBVw_4;1_7KwjlgBVw_4-8-rgb_front;43.83;51.42;"We allow them to fill with oxygen; we allow them to get the fibrous tissue to be much more flexible.";8;20
11183;1_7KwjlgBVw;1_7KwjlgBVw-8-rgb_front;1_7KwjlgBVw_5;1_7KwjlgBVw_5-8-rgb_front;52.21;56.1;So, holding positions and breathing is very important.;8;8
11184;1_N0Aq04tRA;1_N0Aq04tRA-8-rgb_front;1_N0Aq04tRA_0;1_N0Aq04tRA_0-8-rgb_front;0.45;5.17;And now we're going to make a, it's called a, it's a free form teapot.;8;15
11185;1_N0Aq04tRA;1_N0Aq04tRA-8-rgb_front;1_N0Aq04tRA_1;1_N0Aq04tRA_1-8-rgb_front;6.22;9.92;Which means I'm just going to throw it.;8;8
11186;1_N0Aq04tRA;1_N0Aq04tRA-8-rgb_front;1_N0Aq04tRA_10;1_N0Aq04tRA_10-8-rgb_front;35.97;39.3;So you want to start with a nice wedged piece of clay.;8;12
11187;1_N0Aq04tRA;1_N0Aq04tRA-8-rgb_front;1_N0Aq04tRA_11;1_N0Aq04tRA_11-8-rgb_front;39.61;44.85;And you want to remember once you get that wedged that that's the part that's going on the wheel head.;8;20
11188;1_N0Aq04tRA;1_N0Aq04tRA-8-rgb_front;1_N0Aq04tRA_12;1_N0Aq04tRA_12-8-rgb_front;45.31;48.41;And that's the part with the dimple that's going to go up.;8;12
11189;1_N0Aq04tRA;1_N0Aq04tRA-8-rgb_front;1_N0Aq04tRA_13;1_N0Aq04tRA_13-8-rgb_front;48.47;51.97;So other wise, this little dimple will give you problems all the way up.;8;14
11190;1_N0Aq04tRA;1_N0Aq04tRA-8-rgb_front;1_N0Aq04tRA_14;1_N0Aq04tRA_14-8-rgb_front;53.21;55.05;Now we got that, want to bring it to the wheel.;8;11
11191;1_N0Aq04tRA;1_N0Aq04tRA-8-rgb_front;1_N0Aq04tRA_15;1_N0Aq04tRA_15-8-rgb_front;55.63;64.17;Going to clean off our wheel head.;8;7
11192;1_N0Aq04tRA;1_N0Aq04tRA-8-rgb_front;1_N0Aq04tRA_16;1_N0Aq04tRA_16-8-rgb_front;64.17;65.01;From there.;8;2
11193;1_N0Aq04tRA;1_N0Aq04tRA-8-rgb_front;1_N0Aq04tRA_17;1_N0Aq04tRA_17-8-rgb_front;65.21;65.39;Alright.;8;1
11194;1_N0Aq04tRA;1_N0Aq04tRA-8-rgb_front;1_N0Aq04tRA_18;1_N0Aq04tRA_18-8-rgb_front;65.65;67.29;Now I'm going to put that over there.;8;8
11195;1_N0Aq04tRA;1_N0Aq04tRA-8-rgb_front;1_N0Aq04tRA_19;1_N0Aq04tRA_19-8-rgb_front;67.73;68.61;I'm going to save it.;8;5
11196;1_N0Aq04tRA;1_N0Aq04tRA-8-rgb_front;1_N0Aq04tRA_2;1_N0Aq04tRA_2-8-rgb_front;9.92;10.94;I'm going to assemble it.;8;5
11197;1_N0Aq04tRA;1_N0Aq04tRA-8-rgb_front;1_N0Aq04tRA_20;1_N0Aq04tRA_20-8-rgb_front;69.52;71.55;Get this on center as much as possible.;8;8
11198;1_N0Aq04tRA;1_N0Aq04tRA-8-rgb_front;1_N0Aq04tRA_21;1_N0Aq04tRA_21-8-rgb_front;72.49;72.78;Alright.;8;1
11199;1_N0Aq04tRA;1_N0Aq04tRA-8-rgb_front;1_N0Aq04tRA_22;1_N0Aq04tRA_22-8-rgb_front;72.78;74.1;Now we're ready to go.;8;5
11200;1_N0Aq04tRA;1_N0Aq04tRA-8-rgb_front;1_N0Aq04tRA_3;1_N0Aq04tRA_3-8-rgb_front;10.94;12.01;I'm going to move it around.;8;6
11201;1_N0Aq04tRA;1_N0Aq04tRA-8-rgb_front;1_N0Aq04tRA_4;1_N0Aq04tRA_4-8-rgb_front;12.01;17.18;I'm going to make it to where this teapot looks like it's dancing, or I'm going to try.;8;18
11202;1_N0Aq04tRA;1_N0Aq04tRA-8-rgb_front;1_N0Aq04tRA_5;1_N0Aq04tRA_5-8-rgb_front;17.22;21.38;So it's going to look like it's dancing or it's going to look like it's drunk.;8;16
11203;1_N0Aq04tRA;1_N0Aq04tRA-8-rgb_front;1_N0Aq04tRA_6;1_N0Aq04tRA_6-8-rgb_front;22.93;24.21;Either one, it'll be good.;8;5
11204;1_N0Aq04tRA;1_N0Aq04tRA-8-rgb_front;1_N0Aq04tRA_7;1_N0Aq04tRA_7-8-rgb_front;24.64;26.69;And they're fun to make.;8;5
11205;1_N0Aq04tRA;1_N0Aq04tRA-8-rgb_front;1_N0Aq04tRA_8;1_N0Aq04tRA_8-8-rgb_front;26.69;28.01;It's all about assembling.;8;4
11206;1_N0Aq04tRA;1_N0Aq04tRA-8-rgb_front;1_N0Aq04tRA_9;1_N0Aq04tRA_9-8-rgb_front;29.98;35.97;And, throwing these pieces, throwing slabs, all of it, it's real fun.;8;12
11207;1_VJ7epZJAg;1_VJ7epZJAg-8-rgb_front;1_VJ7epZJAg_0;1_VJ7epZJAg_0-8-rgb_front;1.23;11.24;My name is Abby Jones, and I am talking about the process of moving into a new apartment or a new space, and making that process easy and efficient.;8;29
11208;1_VJ7epZJAg;1_VJ7epZJAg-8-rgb_front;1_VJ7epZJAg_1;1_VJ7epZJAg_1-8-rgb_front;11.87;17.98;And right now I'm talking specifically about organizing and moving into a new home office.;8;15
11209;1_VJ7epZJAg;1_VJ7epZJAg-8-rgb_front;1_VJ7epZJAg_2;1_VJ7epZJAg_2-8-rgb_front;18.51;31.83;So one thing that I noticed when I accessed this space was that there's no built in storage, and my furniture doesn't have any built in storage either.;8;28
11210;1_VJ7epZJAg;1_VJ7epZJAg-8-rgb_front;1_VJ7epZJAg_3;1_VJ7epZJAg_3-8-rgb_front;32.3;48.42;So something that I am going to use to create storage are these baskets which you can get at any kind of craft store or that kind of thing, and they kind of create faux drawers.;8;36
11211;1_VJ7epZJAg;1_VJ7epZJAg-8-rgb_front;1_VJ7epZJAg_4;1_VJ7epZJAg_4-8-rgb_front;48.68;71.26;So I'll place them on the shelves, put my things in them, and then I can just pull them out as I need it, but they help keep things contained, I can separate different kinds of supplies, different projects in each basket so it can all be contained in one space.;8;51
11212;1__H9MDl590;1__H9MDl590-8-rgb_front;1__H9MDl590_0;1__H9MDl590_0-8-rgb_front;0.32;5.84;As good of a tool as water-color pencil is, it's not always the obvious choice to use.;8;17
11213;1__H9MDl590;1__H9MDl590-8-rgb_front;1__H9MDl590_1;1__H9MDl590_1-8-rgb_front;6.55;20.02;Some of the detail that I get involved with, as an example, on ...with horsehair, you would think that a water-color pencil would work really well, and I could just go and make these fine lines and use a water-color pencil to do that.;8;44
11214;1__H9MDl590;1__H9MDl590-8-rgb_front;1__H9MDl590_2;1__H9MDl590_2-8-rgb_front;20.65;37.17;Typically, that doesn't work all that well, because what happens, almost every line that you make with a water-color pencil, you can only....you can't get as thin, you can't get as fine a detail, and about every third or fourth line that you make, you have to resharpen.;8;48
11215;1__H9MDl590;1__H9MDl590-8-rgb_front;1__H9MDl590_3;1__H9MDl590_3-8-rgb_front;38.02;44.18;So what would happen is, what you might obviously think a pencil would work great, chances are it won't.;8;19
11216;1__H9MDl590;1__H9MDl590-8-rgb_front;1__H9MDl590_4;1__H9MDl590_4-8-rgb_front;44.18;52.76;So you need to again, you need to experiment with your equipment, find out, okay, can I use a pencil on this, or do I just need a really, really fine brush?;8;32
11217;1__H9MDl590;1__H9MDl590-8-rgb_front;1__H9MDl590_5;1__H9MDl590_5-8-rgb_front;53.18;65.84;And you'll see, as an example in this piece, the only place I used water-color pencil here was on some of the leather, and, all the rest of the pieces is used a really fine brush to get the horsehair.;8;40
11218;1__H9MDl590;1__H9MDl590-8-rgb_front;1__H9MDl590_6;1__H9MDl590_6-8-rgb_front;65.84;71.15;So, again, it just comes with experimenting and knowing your tools, and you can have a lot of fun with it.;8;21
11219;1__H9MDl590;1__H9MDl590-8-rgb_front;1__H9MDl590_7;1__H9MDl590_7-8-rgb_front;71.41;78.62;So as versatile as these pencils are, and as...really...they really work well for a lot of things, but remember, this is water color.;8;23
11220;1__H9MDl590;1__H9MDl590-8-rgb_front;1__H9MDl590_8;1__H9MDl590_8-8-rgb_front;78.68;86.87;So don't rely too much on the extra tools, and always go back to your original good-old fashioned paint and water and brushes, and you'll be happy.;8;27
11221;1_gd9m2tKvQ;1_gd9m2tKvQ-8-rgb_front;1_gd9m2tKvQ_0;1_gd9m2tKvQ_0-8-rgb_front;0.76;2.25;Hi, my name's Lincoln Ward.;8;5
11222;1_gd9m2tKvQ;1_gd9m2tKvQ-8-rgb_front;1_gd9m2tKvQ_1;1_gd9m2tKvQ_1-8-rgb_front;2.28;5.57;I'm the director of the Austin Tennis Center here in Austin, Texas.;8;12

11225;1_gd9m2tKvQ;1_gd9m2tKvQ-8-rgb_front;1_gd9m2tKvQ_2;1_gd9m2tKvQ_2-8-rgb_front;5.81;9.15;Today we're going to talk about how long the string is on your tennis racket.;8;15
11226;1_gd9m2tKvQ;1_gd9m2tKvQ-8-rgb_front;1_gd9m2tKvQ_3;1_gd9m2tKvQ_3-8-rgb_front;9.6;16.25;You'd be surprised that this, this little frame holds almost, or over thirty-six feet of string.;8;16
11227;1_gd9m2tKvQ;1_gd9m2tKvQ-8-rgb_front;1_gd9m2tKvQ_4;1_gd9m2tKvQ_4-8-rgb_front;17.08;25.91;These, the, the mains, which run up and down on your racket, use about eighteen feet worth of string.;8;19
11228;1_gd9m2tKvQ;1_gd9m2tKvQ-8-rgb_front;1_gd9m2tKvQ_5;1_gd9m2tKvQ_5-8-rgb_front;25.94;29.28;These cross sections use about sixteen feet of string.;8;9
11229;1_gd9m2tKvQ;1_gd9m2tKvQ-8-rgb_front;1_gd9m2tKvQ_6;1_gd9m2tKvQ_6-8-rgb_front;29.68;39.13;"However; the string, the exact amount of string you're going to use on your racket will also depend on the size of your, the head of your racket.";8;28

11397;1b7CDv-Ssuw;1b7CDv-Ssuw-8-rgb_front;1b7CDv-Ssuw_12;1b7CDv-Ssuw_12-8-rgb_front;98.92;105.48;You are going to go down three times, one, two three, one, two, three, one, two, three.;8;17
11398;1b7CDv-Ssuw;1b7CDv-Ssuw-8-rgb_front;1b7CDv-Ssuw_13;1b7CDv-Ssuw_13-8-rgb_front;106.02;111.11;That way you start to get a little bit more of matted hair which will hold your style up.;8;19
11399;1b7CDv-Ssuw;1b7CDv-Ssuw-8-rgb_front;1b7CDv-Ssuw_14;1b7CDv-Ssuw_14-8-rgb_front;111.56;122.75;Now since we are doing an afro you would want to do a good amount of that hair where so that way it will stand up the way that an afro would.;8;32
11400;1b7CDv-Ssuw;1b7CDv-Ssuw-8-rgb_front;1b7CDv-Ssuw_15;1b7CDv-Ssuw_15-8-rgb_front;123.45;137.58;So you are going to continue teasing those sections kind of matting them so that way you have more of an afro look.;8;23
11401;1b7CDv-Ssuw;1b7CDv-Ssuw-8-rgb_front;1b7CDv-Ssuw_16;1b7CDv-Ssuw_16-8-rgb_front;137.88;153.1;As you see if I am working up the hair shaft how it kind of begins to form more of your afro look.;8;23
11402;1b7CDv-Ssuw;1b7CDv-Ssuw-8-rgb_front;1b7CDv-Ssuw_17;1b7CDv-Ssuw_17-8-rgb_front;153.54;166.76;Once you curl everything you are going to smooth it a little bit but you don't want to smooth it too much because then you are going to fall, spray it, and then if you need to at any given point you may want to go over and reinforce that bit of a tighter curl.;8;55
11403;1b7CDv-Ssuw;1b7CDv-Ssuw-8-rgb_front;1b7CDv-Ssuw_18;1b7CDv-Ssuw_18-8-rgb_front;167.18;173.31;If you work around with this method throughout your entire head you will get more of what the afro look is.;8;21

11405;1b7CDv-Ssuw;1b7CDv-Ssuw-8-rgb_front;1b7CDv-Ssuw_2;1b7CDv-Ssuw_2-8-rgb_front;11.76;18.6;Once your hair is a little bit longer it makes it a little bit more difficult to get the actual afro style.;8;22

11407;1b7CDv-Ssuw;1b7CDv-Ssuw-8-rgb_front;1b7CDv-Ssuw_4;1b7CDv-Ssuw_4-8-rgb_front;40.63;45.9;Now what you want to do is an X using two bobby pins in order to clip their hair up.;8;20

11412;1b7CDv-Ssuw;1b7CDv-Ssuw-8-rgb_front;1b7CDv-Ssuw_9;1b7CDv-Ssuw_9-8-rgb_front;76.96;86.63;After you have curled those sections, I have already curled a few here on the top, you are going to use a comb and actually back comb the hair up.;8;30
11413;1bA7XtuyoYY;1bA7XtuyoYY-8-rgb_front;1bA7XtuyoYY_0;1bA7XtuyoYY_0-8-rgb_front;0.45;5.3;This exercise is called standing twist, and we're going to use a towel for this exercise.;8;16

11415;1bA7XtuyoYY;1bA7XtuyoYY-8-rgb_front;1bA7XtuyoYY_10;1bA7XtuyoYY_10-8-rgb_front;71.16;72.92;And that is your standing twist.;8;6
11416;1bA7XtuyoYY;1bA7XtuyoYY-8-rgb_front;1bA7XtuyoYY_2;1bA7XtuyoYY_2-8-rgb_front;13.52;21.59;So with your feet about hip width apart, soften your knees, extend your arms, and simply twist from your torso.;8;20
11417;1bA7XtuyoYY;1bA7XtuyoYY-8-rgb_front;1bA7XtuyoYY_3;1bA7XtuyoYY_3-8-rgb_front;22.25;30.38;Now as you're twisting, think about pulling on the ends of the towel, and that will pull your shoulder blades into place.;8;22
11418;1bA7XtuyoYY;1bA7XtuyoYY-8-rgb_front;1bA7XtuyoYY_4;1bA7XtuyoYY_4-8-rgb_front;31.25;34.65;And we're really improving the posture all at the same time.;8;11
11419;1bA7XtuyoYY;1bA7XtuyoYY-8-rgb_front;1bA7XtuyoYY_5;1bA7XtuyoYY_5-8-rgb_front;35.22;40.77;This is a great exercise for the core, while you're strengthening your upper back muscles.;8;15
11420;1bA7XtuyoYY;1bA7XtuyoYY-8-rgb_front;1bA7XtuyoYY_6;1bA7XtuyoYY_6-8-rgb_front;42.01;47.65;So when you breathe, you want to inhale to prepare, exhale as you twist.;8;14
11421;1bA7XtuyoYY;1bA7XtuyoYY-8-rgb_front;1bA7XtuyoYY_7;1bA7XtuyoYY_7-8-rgb_front;48.12;52.89;Inhale as you bring the towel back to the front, exhale as you twist.;8;14

11423;1bA7XtuyoYY;1bA7XtuyoYY-8-rgb_front;1bA7XtuyoYY_9;1bA7XtuyoYY_9-8-rgb_front;65.52;70.7;So perform this exercise for about a minute, and then just lower your arms down and rest.;8;17

11692;1cj15Is-Wjs;1cj15Is-Wjs-8-rgb_front;1cj15Is-Wjs_0;1cj15Is-Wjs_0-8-rgb_front;0.43;1.36;Hi, I'm Tim Gipson.;8;4
11693;1cj15Is-Wjs;1cj15Is-Wjs-8-rgb_front;1cj15Is-Wjs_1;1cj15Is-Wjs_1-8-rgb_front;1.36;3.96;I'm going to talk to you about how to tune up a bandsaw.;8;13
11694;1cj15Is-Wjs;1cj15Is-Wjs-8-rgb_front;1cj15Is-Wjs_10;1cj15Is-Wjs_10-8-rgb_front;73.08;76.59;So, in this case we can see we've got the proper amount of tension.;8;14
11695;1cj15Is-Wjs;1cj15Is-Wjs-8-rgb_front;1cj15Is-Wjs_11;1cj15Is-Wjs_11-8-rgb_front;79.21;79.58;Okay.;8;1
11696;1cj15Is-Wjs;1cj15Is-Wjs-8-rgb_front;1cj15Is-Wjs_12;1cj15Is-Wjs_12-8-rgb_front;79.77;90.42;Next thing we want to do is we want to make sure that the blade is running on the rollers correctly.;8;21
11697;1cj15Is-Wjs;1cj15Is-Wjs-8-rgb_front;1cj15Is-Wjs_13;1cj15Is-Wjs_13-8-rgb_front;95.55;102.01;So, if we open this door then we have the rollers right here.;8;13
11698;1cj15Is-Wjs;1cj15Is-Wjs-8-rgb_front;1cj15Is-Wjs_14;1cj15Is-Wjs_14-8-rgb_front;102.41;107.6;And what you want to make sure is you want to make sure the blade is running right on the inside.;8;21
11699;1cj15Is-Wjs;1cj15Is-Wjs-8-rgb_front;1cj15Is-Wjs_15;1cj15Is-Wjs_15-8-rgb_front;107.6;112.76;Now, if it's not then we can make the adjustment and that would be back here.;8;16
11700;1cj15Is-Wjs;1cj15Is-Wjs-8-rgb_front;1cj15Is-Wjs_16;1cj15Is-Wjs_16-8-rgb_front;113.2;125.79;In tuning up, keeping our bandsaw working good is to check our base and to make sure that it is perpendicular to the blade.;8;24
11701;1cj15Is-Wjs;1cj15Is-Wjs-8-rgb_front;1cj15Is-Wjs_17;1cj15Is-Wjs_17-8-rgb_front;126.36;138.83;And in that case we can use a right angle such as this to come in and to check the blade against that.;8;23
11702;1cj15Is-Wjs;1cj15Is-Wjs-8-rgb_front;1cj15Is-Wjs_18;1cj15Is-Wjs_18-8-rgb_front;138.83;140.57;And then we have adjustments on our table.;8;8
11703;1cj15Is-Wjs;1cj15Is-Wjs-8-rgb_front;1cj15Is-Wjs_19;1cj15Is-Wjs_19-8-rgb_front;143.27;152.81;Then, finally, and it's very important to make sure that the blade stays the right orientation is that we have our blocks that are in here.;8;26
11704;1cj15Is-Wjs;1cj15Is-Wjs-8-rgb_front;1cj15Is-Wjs_2;1cj15Is-Wjs_2-8-rgb_front;4.73;16.23;Now, the most important thing with a bandsaw is definitely we want to make sure that we've got the right tension on the blade so that it keeps it at the appropriate angle to the table that we're trying achieve.;8;40
11705;1cj15Is-Wjs;1cj15Is-Wjs-8-rgb_front;1cj15Is-Wjs_20;1cj15Is-Wjs_20-8-rgb_front;153.11;159.44;And these are either phenolic blocks or hardwood blocks that are to each side of the blade.;8;17
11706;1cj15Is-Wjs;1cj15Is-Wjs-8-rgb_front;1cj15Is-Wjs_21;1cj15Is-Wjs_21-8-rgb_front;159.77;163.16;And that keeps that blade from moving back and forth as you're cutting.;8;13
11707;1cj15Is-Wjs;1cj15Is-Wjs-8-rgb_front;1cj15Is-Wjs_22;1cj15Is-Wjs_22-8-rgb_front;163.78;171.68;And so as those wear down over time you'll want to make sure that you cut new blocks to keep that in there.;8;23
11708;1cj15Is-Wjs;1cj15Is-Wjs-8-rgb_front;1cj15Is-Wjs_23;1cj15Is-Wjs_23-8-rgb_front;172.59;175.14;So, I'm Tim Gipson and that's how to tune up a bandsaw.;8;12
11709;1cj15Is-Wjs;1cj15Is-Wjs-8-rgb_front;1cj15Is-Wjs_3;1cj15Is-Wjs_3-8-rgb_front;16.96;25.63;Now, to keep the right tension on, most of your bandsaws will come with a device such as this.;8;19
11710;1cj15Is-Wjs;1cj15Is-Wjs-8-rgb_front;1cj15Is-Wjs_4;1cj15Is-Wjs_4-8-rgb_front;25.66;30.73;Now you have various widths of band that you can put on of your blades.;8;15
11711;1cj15Is-Wjs;1cj15Is-Wjs-8-rgb_front;1cj15Is-Wjs_5;1cj15Is-Wjs_5-8-rgb_front;31.29;33.88;In this particular case we've got a quarter inch blade.;8;10
11712;1cj15Is-Wjs;1cj15Is-Wjs-8-rgb_front;1cj15Is-Wjs_6;1cj15Is-Wjs_6-8-rgb_front;34.27;42.02;So, you have a tension device back here which has a spring with a red mark on it.;8;18
11713;1cj15Is-Wjs;1cj15Is-Wjs-8-rgb_front;1cj15Is-Wjs_7;1cj15Is-Wjs_7-8-rgb_front;43.35;55.48;So, in this case we want to make sure that this tension is set so that that red mark on that spring is right at the marking on here.;8;29
11714;1cj15Is-Wjs;1cj15Is-Wjs-8-rgb_front;1cj15Is-Wjs_8;1cj15Is-Wjs_8-8-rgb_front;55.94;69.19;Now, another way we can check that is when we move our foot out of the way here, we could also press and check the deflection.;8;26
11715;1cj15Is-Wjs;1cj15Is-Wjs-8-rgb_front;1cj15Is-Wjs_9;1cj15Is-Wjs_9-8-rgb_front;69.8;73.08;And we want to have less than a quarter of an inch of deflection.;8;14
11716;1cp9sjT_1Tc;1cp9sjT_1Tc-8-rgb_front;1cp9sjT_1Tc_0;1cp9sjT_1Tc_0-8-rgb_front;0.17;4.53;KIRK VICKERS: The next exercise, the next core exercise that we're going to do is called the single-leg butterfly.;8;19

11769;1d3UApdR58M;1d3UApdR58M-8-rgb_front;1d3UApdR58M_9;1d3UApdR58M_9-8-rgb_front;30.4;33.81;One, two, three, four.;8;4
11770;1d5AvOuQAUQ;1d5AvOuQAUQ-8-rgb_front;1d5AvOuQAUQ_0;1d5AvOuQAUQ_0-8-rgb_front;0.68;11.32;Well if a person has type one Diabetes then the main focus is for them to eat enough calories and carbohydrates to maintain their weight.;8;25
11771;1d5AvOuQAUQ;1d5AvOuQAUQ-8-rgb_front;1d5AvOuQAUQ_1;1d5AvOuQAUQ_1-8-rgb_front;11.8;20.43;And so we teach people with type on Diabetes to count their carbohydrates, but not necessarily to restrict carbohydrates.;8;19
11772;1d5AvOuQAUQ;1d5AvOuQAUQ-8-rgb_front;1d5AvOuQAUQ_10;1d5AvOuQAUQ_10-8-rgb_front;90.23;99.15;And then a fourth of their plate with the foods that are high in carbohydrates like potatoes, rice, corn, dry beans, peas and noodles and then a fourth of the plate with their meat.;8;34
11773;1d5AvOuQAUQ;1d5AvOuQAUQ-8-rgb_front;1d5AvOuQAUQ_11;1d5AvOuQAUQ_11-8-rgb_front;99.5;108.09;And when they eat that way they naturally reduce calories often without even having to measure their portions out.;8;19
11774;1d5AvOuQAUQ;1d5AvOuQAUQ-8-rgb_front;1d5AvOuQAUQ_12;1d5AvOuQAUQ_12-8-rgb_front;108.19;117.55;So that's kind of the first step is to really get people to consume a lot more of those vegetables that are high fiber, high water content and very low on carbohydrates.;8;32
11775;1d5AvOuQAUQ;1d5AvOuQAUQ-8-rgb_front;1d5AvOuQAUQ_2;1d5AvOuQAUQ_2-8-rgb_front;20.43;30.38;And sometimes people with type one get confused because they see a lot of messages in the media about cutting carbohydrates and actually that would cause them to lose too much weight.;8;32
11776;1d5AvOuQAUQ;1d5AvOuQAUQ-8-rgb_front;1d5AvOuQAUQ_3;1d5AvOuQAUQ_3-8-rgb_front;31.09;39.07;On the other hand, someone with type two Diabetes generally is overweight and so they need to cut carbohydrates as well as the calories in their diets.;8;27
11777;1d5AvOuQAUQ;1d5AvOuQAUQ-8-rgb_front;1d5AvOuQAUQ_4;1d5AvOuQAUQ_4-8-rgb_front;39.07;45.19;So generally when someone has type two Diabetes we try to help them reduce the total calorie intake.;8;18
11778;1d5AvOuQAUQ;1d5AvOuQAUQ-8-rgb_front;1d5AvOuQAUQ_5;1d5AvOuQAUQ_5-8-rgb_front;45.58;54.31;And that includes calories from all foods and so portions are going to be smaller particularly are foods that are high in fat and carbohydrate.;8;25
11779;1d5AvOuQAUQ;1d5AvOuQAUQ-8-rgb_front;1d5AvOuQAUQ_6;1d5AvOuQAUQ_6-8-rgb_front;55.19;63.91;In general we try to encourage people with type two Diabetes to increase their intake of vegetables that are low in sugar and fat.;8;24
11780;1d5AvOuQAUQ;1d5AvOuQAUQ-8-rgb_front;1d5AvOuQAUQ_7;1d5AvOuQAUQ_7-8-rgb_front;64.18;78.1;And those are your broccoli, green beans, cauliflower, onions, lettuce, salad type greens, all of those vegetables that have a lot of fiber in them fill you up without giving you too much energy.;8;34
11781;1d5AvOuQAUQ;1d5AvOuQAUQ-8-rgb_front;1d5AvOuQAUQ_8;1d5AvOuQAUQ_8-8-rgb_front;78.3;88.39;And so the big focus for somebody who has type two Diabetes is to fill half of their plate at dinner time with those that we call free foods.;8;29

11789;1dCbeG4mwVk;1dCbeG4mwVk-8-rgb_front;1dCbeG4mwVk_14;1dCbeG4mwVk_14-8-rgb_front;119.76;135.88;Clouds up there... if you want to create atmosphere in the sky, take your blue and clouds again... all right.;8;20

11795;1dCbeG4mwVk;1dCbeG4mwVk-8-rgb_front;1dCbeG4mwVk_2;1dCbeG4mwVk_2-8-rgb_front;6.78;8.29;I'm a freelance illustrator.;8;4
11796;1dCbeG4mwVk;1dCbeG4mwVk-8-rgb_front;1dCbeG4mwVk_3;1dCbeG4mwVk_3-8-rgb_front;9.1;10.86;Today we're going to talk about how to draw mountains.;8;10
11797;1dCbeG4mwVk;1dCbeG4mwVk-8-rgb_front;1dCbeG4mwVk_4;1dCbeG4mwVk_4-8-rgb_front;11.32;15.44;I pre-sketched one here with little ink lines here how to show how to do it with watercolor.;8;18
11798;1dCbeG4mwVk;1dCbeG4mwVk-8-rgb_front;1dCbeG4mwVk_5;1dCbeG4mwVk_5-8-rgb_front;16.19;21.16;I'm going to go ahead and get the gray blue onto my brush.;8;13
11799;1dCbeG4mwVk;1dCbeG4mwVk-8-rgb_front;1dCbeG4mwVk_6;1dCbeG4mwVk_6-8-rgb_front;21.74;39.85;By doing that you take a little blue, maybe take a little part green, and never try to use black because when you use black it really tends to muddy it, so try to mix it in with some colors.;8;40
11800;1dCbeG4mwVk;1dCbeG4mwVk-8-rgb_front;1dCbeG4mwVk_7;1dCbeG4mwVk_7-8-rgb_front;40.24;48.05;We'll take the side of our brush here and try to get that - if the sun's coming from this way, we'll get the shadow part of the mountain.;8;29
11801;1dCbeG4mwVk;1dCbeG4mwVk-8-rgb_front;1dCbeG4mwVk_8;1dCbeG4mwVk_8-8-rgb_front;49.85;55.42;So it's kind of like a greenish blue color that you want to create, 'cause it creates that stone.;8;19
11802;1dCbeG4mwVk;1dCbeG4mwVk-8-rgb_front;1dCbeG4mwVk_9;1dCbeG4mwVk_9-8-rgb_front;58.03;69.52;From the other end it could be more - you can try to get the yellow part of it, of the sun hitting it on that side.;8;27
11803;1dFd3NYkINQ;1dFd3NYkINQ-8-rgb_front;1dFd3NYkINQ_0;1dFd3NYkINQ_0-8-rgb_front;1.34;2.57;These are my kilns.;8;4
11804;1dFd3NYkINQ;1dFd3NYkINQ-8-rgb_front;1dFd3NYkINQ_1;1dFd3NYkINQ_1-8-rgb_front;2.57;7.98;This kiln is a really huge one and because my work is so little I don't fire it.;8;18
11805;1dFd3NYkINQ;1dFd3NYkINQ-8-rgb_front;1dFd3NYkINQ_10;1dFd3NYkINQ_10-8-rgb_front;84.07;88.19;And I turn it up to medium and fire it for another hour.;8;13
11806;1dFd3NYkINQ;1dFd3NYkINQ-8-rgb_front;1dFd3NYkINQ_11;1dFd3NYkINQ_11-8-rgb_front;89.09;92.76;All this time this lid is shut down.;8;8
11807;1dFd3NYkINQ;1dFd3NYkINQ-8-rgb_front;1dFd3NYkINQ_12;1dFd3NYkINQ_12-8-rgb_front;93.21;96.11;And then I turn it on high for an hour.;8;10
11808;1dFd3NYkINQ;1dFd3NYkINQ-8-rgb_front;1dFd3NYkINQ_13;1dFd3NYkINQ_13-8-rgb_front;96.41;113.62;And after an hour I plug up the peep hole and it will just go for anywhere from three to six hours longer depending on how much green ware is in your kiln.;8;33
11809;1dFd3NYkINQ;1dFd3NYkINQ-8-rgb_front;1dFd3NYkINQ_14;1dFd3NYkINQ_14-8-rgb_front;113.62;115.34;Or how old your elements are.;8;6
11810;1dFd3NYkINQ;1dFd3NYkINQ-8-rgb_front;1dFd3NYkINQ_15;1dFd3NYkINQ_15-8-rgb_front;115.34;119.37;Because as the elements get older, it takes longer to fire.;8;11
11811;1dFd3NYkINQ;1dFd3NYkINQ-8-rgb_front;1dFd3NYkINQ_16;1dFd3NYkINQ_16-8-rgb_front;121.82;125.91;I have a head that I fired inside the kiln.;8;10
11812;1dFd3NYkINQ;1dFd3NYkINQ-8-rgb_front;1dFd3NYkINQ_17;1dFd3NYkINQ_17-8-rgb_front;126.42;129.52;It?s sitting on a bed of what's called prop pet.;8;10
11813;1dFd3NYkINQ;1dFd3NYkINQ-8-rgb_front;1dFd3NYkINQ_18;1dFd3NYkINQ_18-8-rgb_front;129.52;133.81;This is kind of like asbestos like material.;8;8
11814;1dFd3NYkINQ;1dFd3NYkINQ-8-rgb_front;1dFd3NYkINQ_19;1dFd3NYkINQ_19-8-rgb_front;134.3;149.94;The shoulder plate I have the prop pet stuffed inside because if I just had it in the kiln like this when it gets hot it would tend to want to close down and break at the shoulders.;8;38
11815;1dFd3NYkINQ;1dFd3NYkINQ-8-rgb_front;1dFd3NYkINQ_2;1dFd3NYkINQ_2-8-rgb_front;8.01;16.28;This one fires on two twenty but this is a small electric kiln that actually fires on household current.;8;19
11816;1dFd3NYkINQ;1dFd3NYkINQ-8-rgb_front;1dFd3NYkINQ_20;1dFd3NYkINQ_20-8-rgb_front;149.94;158.76;So I put this cottony prop pet stuff inside to support it during the firing.;8;15
11817;1dFd3NYkINQ;1dFd3NYkINQ-8-rgb_front;1dFd3NYkINQ_21;1dFd3NYkINQ_21-8-rgb_front;160.27;167.48;When it goes in its white in color and very chalky and very fragile.;8;14
11818;1dFd3NYkINQ;1dFd3NYkINQ-8-rgb_front;1dFd3NYkINQ_22;1dFd3NYkINQ_22-8-rgb_front;167.48;172.12;And then this it comes out of the kiln with this color.;8;12
11819;1dFd3NYkINQ;1dFd3NYkINQ-8-rgb_front;1dFd3NYkINQ_23;1dFd3NYkINQ_23-8-rgb_front;172.33;177.52;As I mentioned earlier, the porcelain slip has the color in it.;8;12
11820;1dFd3NYkINQ;1dFd3NYkINQ-8-rgb_front;1dFd3NYkINQ_3;1dFd3NYkINQ_3-8-rgb_front;16.47;28.37;The way that a kiln works is that it pours and fires to a temperature of o cone six which is around twenty six hundred degrees.;8;26
11821;1dFd3NYkINQ;1dFd3NYkINQ-8-rgb_front;1dFd3NYkINQ_4;1dFd3NYkINQ_4-8-rgb_front;28.37;43.16;So I use one of these little bars which are called a cone and when it gets to the proper temperature this little bar inside will melt.;8;27
11822;1dFd3NYkINQ;1dFd3NYkINQ-8-rgb_front;1dFd3NYkINQ_5;1dFd3NYkINQ_5-8-rgb_front;43.84;56.32;I put it in, I put the cone in like this into the cone, cone holder and this little switch goes back and forth.;8;24
11823;1dFd3NYkINQ;1dFd3NYkINQ-8-rgb_front;1dFd3NYkINQ_6;1dFd3NYkINQ_6-8-rgb_front;56.37;66.38;And when this melts it'll then trigger this latch to go, to go down and turn the kiln off automatically.;8;20
11824;1dFd3NYkINQ;1dFd3NYkINQ-8-rgb_front;1dFd3NYkINQ_7;1dFd3NYkINQ_7-8-rgb_front;66.99;74.83;I put my porcelain in and I turn it on low for about an hour with, this is called a peep hole.;8;22
11825;1dFd3NYkINQ;1dFd3NYkINQ-8-rgb_front;1dFd3NYkINQ_8;1dFd3NYkINQ_8-8-rgb_front;76.09;80.25;And the peep hole needs to be unplugged when you first start up on your kiln.;8;16
11826;1dFd3NYkINQ;1dFd3NYkINQ-8-rgb_front;1dFd3NYkINQ_9;1dFd3NYkINQ_9-8-rgb_front;81.81;84.07;And I fire it for about an hour on low.;8;10
11827;1dJbYUmWpSY;1dJbYUmWpSY-8-rgb_front;1dJbYUmWpSY_1;1dJbYUmWpSY_1-8-rgb_front;9.48;23.67;We learned in our class something called well we call it the pat maneuver a LAPD officer Pat Bailey one our mentors thought us how to do this and we share this with parents because we found this the easiest way to install the seat.;8;45
11828;1dJbYUmWpSY;1dJbYUmWpSY-8-rgb_front;1dJbYUmWpSY_10;1dJbYUmWpSY_10-8-rgb_front;79.12;86.19;You can also notice because there is leather in this vehicle that we use a piece of non sticky material to help keep it from sliding around.;8;27
11829;1dJbYUmWpSY;1dJbYUmWpSY-8-rgb_front;1dJbYUmWpSY_11;1dJbYUmWpSY_11-8-rgb_front;86.23;92.89;We have also because of the seat lopes in the vehicle using a pool noodle to adjust for angle.;8;19
11830;1dJbYUmWpSY;1dJbYUmWpSY-8-rgb_front;1dJbYUmWpSY_12;1dJbYUmWpSY_12-8-rgb_front;92.98;104.33;The most important part is in installing a infant or parenting me a convertible seat is to make sure you have a 45 degree angle for a infant that does not have full head control or neck control.;8;38
11831;1dJbYUmWpSY;1dJbYUmWpSY-8-rgb_front;1dJbYUmWpSY_13;1dJbYUmWpSY_13-8-rgb_front;104.84;110.54;If it is a child that has head control the angle does not need to be quiet 45 in could be a little more steep.;8;25
11832;1dJbYUmWpSY;1dJbYUmWpSY-8-rgb_front;1dJbYUmWpSY_14;1dJbYUmWpSY_14-8-rgb_front;110.77;113.31;But you never ever would want it in a 90 like this.;8;12
11833;1dJbYUmWpSY;1dJbYUmWpSY-8-rgb_front;1dJbYUmWpSY_15;1dJbYUmWpSY_15-8-rgb_front;113.84;129.17;So what Andrea and Pat though us to do would be to use your body to weight the sit I can reach down here and pull through this way like this and then I can rock the sit like this when I'm pulling in order to get it tight.;8;49
11834;1dJbYUmWpSY;1dJbYUmWpSY-8-rgb_front;1dJbYUmWpSY_16;1dJbYUmWpSY_16-8-rgb_front;129.39;138.89;I have also Dan have switched the belt we need a locking magnetism and Dan is pulling the belt and we are rocking the sit side to side.;8;28
11835;1dJbYUmWpSY;1dJbYUmWpSY-8-rgb_front;1dJbYUmWpSY_17;1dJbYUmWpSY_17-8-rgb_front;139.28;151.38;Then it feeds up in the magnetism the belt is locked and when you try to move the sit you always check your sit for installation at the belt path and when you try to move it side to side it is not moving and that is the proper way to install.;8;52
11836;1dJbYUmWpSY;1dJbYUmWpSY-8-rgb_front;1dJbYUmWpSY_18;1dJbYUmWpSY_18-8-rgb_front;151.71;158.16;So the easies way to do this is with our pat maneuver by climbing up in the sit and rocking it and getting it nice and tight.;8;27
11837;1dJbYUmWpSY;1dJbYUmWpSY-8-rgb_front;1dJbYUmWpSY_2;1dJbYUmWpSY_2-8-rgb_front;24.03;29.82;So the first thing Pat thought use was to move th front seat all the way forward and get it out of the way.;8;24
11838;1dJbYUmWpSY;1dJbYUmWpSY-8-rgb_front;1dJbYUmWpSY_3;1dJbYUmWpSY_3-8-rgb_front;31.06;37.43;And doing this could be a little harder in smaller vehicle but it still could be done.;8;17
11839;1dJbYUmWpSY;1dJbYUmWpSY-8-rgb_front;1dJbYUmWpSY_4;1dJbYUmWpSY_4-8-rgb_front;38.32;46.58;The second thing we want to do is to make sure that there is nothing on the floor so when we get in here cause we are going to have to stand here so you want to have the floors empty.;8;41
11840;1dJbYUmWpSY;1dJbYUmWpSY-8-rgb_front;1dJbYUmWpSY_5;1dJbYUmWpSY_5-8-rgb_front;46.96;51.43;Okay third thing is now you are going to climb in to the seat.;8;14
11841;1dJbYUmWpSY;1dJbYUmWpSY-8-rgb_front;1dJbYUmWpSY_6;1dJbYUmWpSY_6-8-rgb_front;52.62;54.51;Get in.;8;2
11842;1dJbYUmWpSY;1dJbYUmWpSY-8-rgb_front;1dJbYUmWpSY_7;1dJbYUmWpSY_7-8-rgb_front;55.23;65.93;Okay we have already run this through the belt path convertibles has two belt paths on of them is a rear facing belt path right here when it is in this position.;8;32
11843;1dJbYUmWpSY;1dJbYUmWpSY-8-rgb_front;1dJbYUmWpSY_8;1dJbYUmWpSY_8-8-rgb_front;66.44;72.48;The forward facing belt path is right here so if the seat was turned around facing this way you would then use this belt path.;8;25
11844;1dJbYUmWpSY;1dJbYUmWpSY-8-rgb_front;1dJbYUmWpSY_9;1dJbYUmWpSY_9-8-rgb_front;72.48;78.81;But since we are facing when you run the lap shoulder belt through here and the seat still moves around and it is still loose.;8;25

11982;1eZfIr9oNZo;1eZfIr9oNZo-8-rgb_front;1eZfIr9oNZo_3;1eZfIr9oNZo_3-8-rgb_front;41.47;66.92;So notice that I hit a good boast, I'm able to hit the ball down the wall now and Gary counters with a good boast and now he works me into the back corner and now I get my chance to attack.;8;42
11983;1eZfIr9oNZo;1eZfIr9oNZo-8-rgb_front;1eZfIr9oNZo_4;1eZfIr9oNZo_4-8-rgb_front;66.92;88.59;He is working me in the front and now I get a chance for a length, another length.;8;18

12130;1fTH1XCkQNw;1fTH1XCkQNw-8-rgb_front;1fTH1XCkQNw_4;1fTH1XCkQNw_4-8-rgb_front;29.13;35.94;Then you hit the ground and you do the same thing again, you're leaning in the direction you want to turn and then you torque the unicycle in that direction to come with you.;8;34

12139;1fZfM65z0zk;1fZfM65z0zk-8-rgb_front;1fZfM65z0zk_12;1fZfM65z0zk_12-8-rgb_front;84.92;96.51;You want to pop out those cheek bones especially on stage because you want to give the appearance of having perfect bone structure, right?;8;24

12142;1fZfM65z0zk;1fZfM65z0zk-8-rgb_front;1fZfM65z0zk_15;1fZfM65z0zk_15-8-rgb_front;101.55;107.37;Makeup does so many origins, and as you can see, I'm putting it right here on the base of her nose.;8;21

12145;1fZfM65z0zk;1fZfM65z0zk-8-rgb_front;1fZfM65z0zk_18;1fZfM65z0zk_18-8-rgb_front;116.1;129.8;Make sure that it's very, very smoothed out and you don't want it clumpy and you want to make sure, and as you can see, I'm not...I'm not doing it in a way that I would be painting, I'm actually pushing down on it with a brush.;8;47
12146;1fZfM65z0zk;1fZfM65z0zk-8-rgb_front;1fZfM65z0zk_19;1fZfM65z0zk_19-8-rgb_front;130.17;152.93;So you push down on it to get that nice perfect skin tone, and as you can see I went all the way up into this space right here with that concealer, and we're going to do that exact same thing on the other side of the face.;8;48
12147;1fZfM65z0zk;1fZfM65z0zk-8-rgb_front;1fZfM65z0zk_2;1fZfM65z0zk_2-8-rgb_front;9.81;15.45;So, they're very, very, almost feels like they're wet feeling, and this is concealer.;8;14

12150;1fZfM65z0zk;1fZfM65z0zk-8-rgb_front;1fZfM65z0zk_22;1fZfM65z0zk_22-8-rgb_front;166.23;170.75;And make sure that it's very nicely and evenly smoothed out.;8;11
12151;1fZfM65z0zk;1fZfM65z0zk-8-rgb_front;1fZfM65z0zk_23;1fZfM65z0zk_23-8-rgb_front;177.77;178.17;There we go.;8;3

12153;1fZfM65z0zk;1fZfM65z0zk-8-rgb_front;1fZfM65z0zk_4;1fZfM65z0zk_4-8-rgb_front;21.79;29.31;You don't want to go too light though, or you don't want to go where it's too dark because concealer is used to bring out features in the face.;8;29
12154;1fZfM65z0zk;1fZfM65z0zk-8-rgb_front;1fZfM65z0zk_5;1fZfM65z0zk_5-8-rgb_front;29.31;32.51;And usually concealer is not used over the entire face.;8;10
12155;1fZfM65z0zk;1fZfM65z0zk-8-rgb_front;1fZfM65z0zk_6;1fZfM65z0zk_6-8-rgb_front;32.51;37.01;It's just used to cover up different things like under the eyes.;8;12
12156;1fZfM65z0zk;1fZfM65z0zk-8-rgb_front;1fZfM65z0zk_7;1fZfM65z0zk_7-8-rgb_front;37.93;43.1;This covers up as we call it, those skunk eyes...raccoon eyes is what I mean.;8;15
12157;1fZfM65z0zk;1fZfM65z0zk-8-rgb_front;1fZfM65z0zk_8;1fZfM65z0zk_8-8-rgb_front;44.26;45.13;Raccoon eyes.;8;2

12159;1fdMM1LuAsY;1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front;1fdMM1LuAsY_0;1fdMM1LuAsY_0-8-rgb_front;4.17;10.36;Hi I'm Evan from Gregg's Greenway Cycles and today we're going to go over how to tighten or loosen your brakes on your bicycle.;8;24
12160;1fdMM1LuAsY;1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front;1fdMM1LuAsY_1;1fdMM1LuAsY_1-8-rgb_front;10.74;18.94;The first thing that you want to do when tightening or loosening your breaks is decide where exactly it's comfortable for you to pull on the lever.;8;27
12161;1fdMM1LuAsY;1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front;1fdMM1LuAsY_10;1fdMM1LuAsY_10-8-rgb_front;61.31;70.96;And then also a secondary method to adjust the tightness or looseness of your brakes, is to come back to the actual caliper itself, here on the back of the bike.;8;31
12162;1fdMM1LuAsY;1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front;1fdMM1LuAsY_11;1fdMM1LuAsY_11-8-rgb_front;72.95;80.54;With a five millimeter allen key, you can actually adjust the pull right at the brake caliper itself.;8;18
12163;1fdMM1LuAsY;1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front;1fdMM1LuAsY_12;1fdMM1LuAsY_12-8-rgb_front;80.64;91.96;So you can just adjust how much cable is being pulled right at the caliper, and it's kind of a hit and miss since you can't be pulling and adjust at the same time.;8;34
12164;1fdMM1LuAsY;1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front;1fdMM1LuAsY_13;1fdMM1LuAsY_13-8-rgb_front;91.96;95.82;So you kind of have to make an adjustment, then check you pull.;8;13
12165;1fdMM1LuAsY;1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front;1fdMM1LuAsY_14;1fdMM1LuAsY_14-8-rgb_front;96.44;101.15;And that seems a little bit too tight, so maybe you let just a little bit more out.;8;18
12166;1fdMM1LuAsY;1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front;1fdMM1LuAsY_15;1fdMM1LuAsY_15-8-rgb_front;105.6;105.86;There.;8;1
12167;1fdMM1LuAsY;1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front;1fdMM1LuAsY_16;1fdMM1LuAsY_16-8-rgb_front;107.39;110.74;Then give it another pull, and that feels good.;8;9
12168;1fdMM1LuAsY;1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front;1fdMM1LuAsY_17;1fdMM1LuAsY_17-8-rgb_front;111.09;116.79;And then your last check is to make sure that your pads aren't rubbing on either your disc rotor or on your wheel.;8;23
12169;1fdMM1LuAsY;1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front;1fdMM1LuAsY_18;1fdMM1LuAsY_18-8-rgb_front;117.02;119.95;And in this case we have a disc rotor, and so it sounds good.;8;14
12170;1fdMM1LuAsY;1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front;1fdMM1LuAsY_19;1fdMM1LuAsY_19-8-rgb_front;120.11;123.09;There's no pad rubbing, the wheel isn't dragging at all.;8;10
12171;1fdMM1LuAsY;1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front;1fdMM1LuAsY_2;1fdMM1LuAsY_2-8-rgb_front;19.59;24.02;If you like it to pull all the way back to the bar, then you know that you need to loosen up your brakes a little bit.;8;27
12172;1fdMM1LuAsY;1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front;1fdMM1LuAsY_20_21_22;1fdMM1LuAsY_20_21_22-8-rgb_front;124.29;132.99;The pull is good, nice and comfortable. Not too far, not too close. And that is how you adjust your brakes.;8;21
12173;1fdMM1LuAsY;1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front;1fdMM1LuAsY_3;1fdMM1LuAsY_3-8-rgb_front;24.17;30.15;And if you like just a little bit of pull before your breaks start to engage, then you know you need to tighten them up.;8;25
12174;1fdMM1LuAsY;1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front;1fdMM1LuAsY_4;1fdMM1LuAsY_4-8-rgb_front;30.15;34.63;One of the easiest adjustments you can make when tightening your brakes, is with the barrel adjuster here.;8;18
12175;1fdMM1LuAsY;1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front;1fdMM1LuAsY_5;1fdMM1LuAsY_5-8-rgb_front;35.41;40.96;And you just go ahead and spin it clockwise until you feel you're getting an adequate amount of pull.;8;19
12176;1fdMM1LuAsY;1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front;1fdMM1LuAsY_6;1fdMM1LuAsY_6-8-rgb_front;41.0;42.06;Whatever feels good for you.;8;5
12177;1fdMM1LuAsY;1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front;1fdMM1LuAsY_7;1fdMM1LuAsY_7-8-rgb_front;44.32;49.45;And then that looks right about good about there, pulling about half way before it starts to engage.;8;18
12178;1fdMM1LuAsY;1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front;1fdMM1LuAsY_8;1fdMM1LuAsY_8-8-rgb_front;49.9;58.42;And then this nut here, go ahead and lock that down so that this one is keeping this one stationary up against the lever body.;8;25
12179;1fdMM1LuAsY;1fdMM1LuAsY-8-rgb_front;1fdMM1LuAsY_9;1fdMM1LuAsY_9-8-rgb_front;59.25;60.9;So that's one way to go ahead and do it.;8;10

12204;1furuv5lJ4Q;1furuv5lJ4Q-8-rgb_front;1furuv5lJ4Q_2;1furuv5lJ4Q_2-8-rgb_front;5.58;8.67;The reason for this is to remove all dry and dead skin cells.;8;13
12205;1furuv5lJ4Q;1furuv5lJ4Q-8-rgb_front;1furuv5lJ4Q_3;1furuv5lJ4Q_3-8-rgb_front;9.0;10.78;You want to use your buffing cream.;8;7

12208;1g8yWLfws8I;1g8yWLfws8I-8-rgb_front;1g8yWLfws8I_0;1g8yWLfws8I_0-8-rgb_front;0.36;4.08;So the first step in trimming any piece is to make sure that it's centered.;8;15
12209;1g8yWLfws8I;1g8yWLfws8I-8-rgb_front;1g8yWLfws8I_1;1g8yWLfws8I_1-8-rgb_front;4.53;10.43;And the way that you do that is start the wheel head spinning, and you're going to see that it's a little off center right now.;8;26
12210;1g8yWLfws8I;1g8yWLfws8I-8-rgb_front;1g8yWLfws8I_10;1g8yWLfws8I_10-8-rgb_front;45.73;49.11;It doesn't need to be changed in shape very much.;8;10
12211;1g8yWLfws8I;1g8yWLfws8I-8-rgb_front;1g8yWLfws8I_11;1g8yWLfws8I_11-8-rgb_front;49.24;55.17;But on the inner piece, you can see there's a little corner, a little ledge, and I don't want that to be there.;8;23
12212;1g8yWLfws8I;1g8yWLfws8I-8-rgb_front;1g8yWLfws8I_12;1g8yWLfws8I_12-8-rgb_front;55.2;68.53;So I'm going to remove that with my ribbon tool as well.;8;12
12213;1g8yWLfws8I;1g8yWLfws8I-8-rgb_front;1g8yWLfws8I_13;1g8yWLfws8I_13-8-rgb_front;68.7;76.8;So once that's smooth, the next thing you do is you smooth the bottom of the piece out with your sponge.;8;21
12214;1g8yWLfws8I;1g8yWLfws8I-8-rgb_front;1g8yWLfws8I_14;1g8yWLfws8I_14-8-rgb_front;78.48;85.36;This is going to be the last time you're going to touch the bottom of it before you fire it, so make sure it's to your satisfaction.;8;27
12215;1g8yWLfws8I;1g8yWLfws8I-8-rgb_front;1g8yWLfws8I_15;1g8yWLfws8I_15-8-rgb_front;86.92;97.63;And now is the time when you would either sign in your name, or push in your impression with a stamp that you've either made yourself and fired, or a rubber stamp that you've had made at a rubber stamp company.;8;41
12216;1g8yWLfws8I;1g8yWLfws8I-8-rgb_front;1g8yWLfws8I_16;1g8yWLfws8I_16-8-rgb_front;99.32;102.54;Push that in there, and we're ready to do the trimming on the bowl.;8;14
12217;1g8yWLfws8I;1g8yWLfws8I-8-rgb_front;1g8yWLfws8I_2;1g8yWLfws8I_2-8-rgb_front;10.62;13.2;So, it's a process that takes a little while to learn.;8;11
12218;1g8yWLfws8I;1g8yWLfws8I-8-rgb_front;1g8yWLfws8I_3;1g8yWLfws8I_3-8-rgb_front;13.2;14.55;It's called tapping on the center.;8;6
12219;1g8yWLfws8I;1g8yWLfws8I-8-rgb_front;1g8yWLfws8I_4;1g8yWLfws8I_4-8-rgb_front;15.1;18.32;But you really just pat the pot, give it a little spank.;8;12
12220;1g8yWLfws8I;1g8yWLfws8I-8-rgb_front;1g8yWLfws8I_5;1g8yWLfws8I_5-8-rgb_front;19.48;28.35;It's kind of counter intuitive, because you're hitting, at first you're going to want to hit at the wrong place and you're going to make it more off center.;8;29
12221;1g8yWLfws8I;1g8yWLfws8I-8-rgb_front;1g8yWLfws8I_6;1g8yWLfws8I_6-8-rgb_front;28.38;31.45;Give yourself some patience with that.;8;6
12222;1g8yWLfws8I;1g8yWLfws8I-8-rgb_front;1g8yWLfws8I_7;1g8yWLfws8I_7-8-rgb_front;31.52;34.25;Once you've got it on center, you're going to take your ribbon tool.;8;13
12223;1g8yWLfws8I;1g8yWLfws8I-8-rgb_front;1g8yWLfws8I_8;1g8yWLfws8I_8-8-rgb_front;34.96;40.6;This is called a ribbon tool because when you go to trimming, it makes a ribbon of clay that peels right off of the piece.;8;25
12224;1g8yWLfws8I;1g8yWLfws8I-8-rgb_front;1g8yWLfws8I_9;1g8yWLfws8I_9-8-rgb_front;41.29;45.73;So I just want on the outside part, to make it smooth.;8;12

12267;1gDezSEPi_o;1gDezSEPi_o-8-rgb_front;1gDezSEPi_o_7;1gDezSEPi_o_7-8-rgb_front;31.61;39.76;And, we're going to add in two ounces of lime juice, which is about four good squeezes.;8;17
12268;1gDezSEPi_o;1gDezSEPi_o-8-rgb_front;1gDezSEPi_o_8;1gDezSEPi_o_8-8-rgb_front;40.35;43.02;So, this is going to be a very lime flavored drink.;8;11
12269;1gDezSEPi_o;1gDezSEPi_o-8-rgb_front;1gDezSEPi_o_9;1gDezSEPi_o_9-8-rgb_front;43.83;44.48;Alright.;8;1
12270;1gOQLPDtr3c;1gOQLPDtr3c-8-rgb_front;1gOQLPDtr3c_0;1gOQLPDtr3c_0-8-rgb_front;0.56;5.55;Hi, my name is Chell Garcia-Trias, and I'm a modern dancer in Austin Texas.;8;14
12271;1gOQLPDtr3c;1gOQLPDtr3c-8-rgb_front;1gOQLPDtr3c_1;1gOQLPDtr3c_1-8-rgb_front;6.04;10.18;I'm going to show you how to do downward dog, which is a yoga position.;8;15
12272;1gOQLPDtr3c;1gOQLPDtr3c-8-rgb_front;1gOQLPDtr3c_10;1gOQLPDtr3c_10-8-rgb_front;65.48;67.55;There's a lot of things to think about here.;8;9
12273;1gOQLPDtr3c;1gOQLPDtr3c-8-rgb_front;1gOQLPDtr3c_11;1gOQLPDtr3c_11-8-rgb_front;68.02;70.25;And everybody is going to be in a different place with it.;8;12
12274;1gOQLPDtr3c;1gOQLPDtr3c-8-rgb_front;1gOQLPDtr3c_12;1gOQLPDtr3c_12-8-rgb_front;70.25;73.01;You might feel you can't bring your heels to the ground, that's fine.;8;13
12275;1gOQLPDtr3c;1gOQLPDtr3c-8-rgb_front;1gOQLPDtr3c_13;1gOQLPDtr3c_13-8-rgb_front;73.27;77.19;You might find you're not ready to straighten your legs, bend your knees a little bit, that's fine.;8;18
12276;1gOQLPDtr3c;1gOQLPDtr3c-8-rgb_front;1gOQLPDtr3c_14;1gOQLPDtr3c_14-8-rgb_front;77.55;81.36;Really, push through all of the fingers through your hands and the palms of your hands.;8;16
12277;1gOQLPDtr3c;1gOQLPDtr3c-8-rgb_front;1gOQLPDtr3c_15;1gOQLPDtr3c_15-8-rgb_front;81.36;92.74;It's really important, whatever position you're in here, that you're pushing through your shoulder blades, pushing them into the ground, dropping your shoulders, pushing your arms, reaching with your hips.;8;30
12278;1gOQLPDtr3c;1gOQLPDtr3c-8-rgb_front;1gOQLPDtr3c_16;1gOQLPDtr3c_16-8-rgb_front;93.93;102.6;Take deep breaths while you're there, so that you're relaxing and releasing, and deepening the stretch.;8;16
12279;1gOQLPDtr3c;1gOQLPDtr3c-8-rgb_front;1gOQLPDtr3c_17;1gOQLPDtr3c_17-8-rgb_front;103.2;108.5;You'll feel a nice intense stretch all the way into your calves in that position.;8;15
12280;1gOQLPDtr3c;1gOQLPDtr3c-8-rgb_front;1gOQLPDtr3c_18;1gOQLPDtr3c_18-8-rgb_front;109.43;113.39;So that is a great way to do downward dog when you're in modern dance.;8;15
12281;1gOQLPDtr3c;1gOQLPDtr3c-8-rgb_front;1gOQLPDtr3c_2;1gOQLPDtr3c_2-8-rgb_front;10.29;14.52;However, I do it the way I learned it in modern dance, which is a little bit different.;8;18
12282;1gOQLPDtr3c;1gOQLPDtr3c-8-rgb_front;1gOQLPDtr3c_3;1gOQLPDtr3c_3-8-rgb_front;14.75;20.78;So, basically I'm going to come to all fours, as if I was in a dog position.;8;17
12283;1gOQLPDtr3c;1gOQLPDtr3c-8-rgb_front;1gOQLPDtr3c_4;1gOQLPDtr3c_4-8-rgb_front;21.08;27.26;But then I'm going to push my knees off of the ground, and I'm going to push my hips up towards the ceiling.;8;23
12284;1gOQLPDtr3c;1gOQLPDtr3c-8-rgb_front;1gOQLPDtr3c_5;1gOQLPDtr3c_5-8-rgb_front;27.54;33.18;As much as possible I want to have a tight little angle there, a flat back, and straight legs.;8;19
12285;1gOQLPDtr3c;1gOQLPDtr3c-8-rgb_front;1gOQLPDtr3c_6;1gOQLPDtr3c_6-8-rgb_front;33.18;37.74;And I want to push my ankles towards the ground, my heels towards the ground.;8;15
12286;1gOQLPDtr3c;1gOQLPDtr3c-8-rgb_front;1gOQLPDtr3c_7;1gOQLPDtr3c_7-8-rgb_front;38.54;45.75;So, I'm going to put my hands down on the ground, tuck my toes under, and push my hips towards the ceiling.;8;22
12287;1gOQLPDtr3c;1gOQLPDtr3c-8-rgb_front;1gOQLPDtr3c_8;1gOQLPDtr3c_8-8-rgb_front;47.8;57.61;While I'm in this position, I'm going to drop my shoulders, I do not want my shoulders up by my ears, I want to drop them into my back, drop my shoulder blades into my back.;8;36
12288;1gOQLPDtr3c;1gOQLPDtr3c-8-rgb_front;1gOQLPDtr3c_9;1gOQLPDtr3c_9-8-rgb_front;57.73;65.19;Push through my hands, push through my feet, drop my heels towards the ground, straighten my knees.;8;17
12289;1gS4Hb9gpOI;1gS4Hb9gpOI-8-rgb_front;1gS4Hb9gpOI_0;1gS4Hb9gpOI_0-8-rgb_front;0.26;4.9;Okay, another way you can fix an error is...kind of goes back to not making it in the first place.;8;20
12290;1gS4Hb9gpOI;1gS4Hb9gpOI-8-rgb_front;1gS4Hb9gpOI_1;1gS4Hb9gpOI_1-8-rgb_front;4.9;11.43;And one of the ways that I find that I make less and less errors, is I'm more comfortable where I'm at in my studio.;8;25
12291;1gS4Hb9gpOI;1gS4Hb9gpOI-8-rgb_front;1gS4Hb9gpOI_10;1gS4Hb9gpOI_10-8-rgb_front;57.16;60.06;So, that's one of my secrets, and I hope it works for ya.;8;13
12292;1gS4Hb9gpOI;1gS4Hb9gpOI-8-rgb_front;1gS4Hb9gpOI_2;1gS4Hb9gpOI_2-8-rgb_front;11.46;13.9;And I have a nice set-up where I work.;8;9
12293;1gS4Hb9gpOI;1gS4Hb9gpOI-8-rgb_front;1gS4Hb9gpOI_3;1gS4Hb9gpOI_3-8-rgb_front;14.34;16.71;I have music that I listen to, and things like that.;8;11
12294;1gS4Hb9gpOI;1gS4Hb9gpOI-8-rgb_front;1gS4Hb9gpOI_4;1gS4Hb9gpOI_4-8-rgb_front;17.07;18.96;What happens is, there's less stress.;8;6
12295;1gS4Hb9gpOI;1gS4Hb9gpOI-8-rgb_front;1gS4Hb9gpOI_5;1gS4Hb9gpOI_5-8-rgb_front;19.24;27.35;And if....if you're in a peaceful place, and it's less stress, and you're doing what you love to do, you're probably not going to make as many mistakes.;8;28
12296;1gS4Hb9gpOI;1gS4Hb9gpOI-8-rgb_front;1gS4Hb9gpOI_6;1gS4Hb9gpOI_6-8-rgb_front;27.58;37.54;So if you're prone to painting at the kitchen table while you're cooking dinner and the kids are running in and out of the house, and the husband's not home yet, might not...you might make some errors and you might not be able to fix them.;8;46
12297;1gS4Hb9gpOI;1gS4Hb9gpOI-8-rgb_front;1gS4Hb9gpOI_7;1gS4Hb9gpOI_7-8-rgb_front;37.54;47.31;But if you can find a nice, secluded place where you can actually paint, and be by yourself, and be comfortable where you're at, you won't make as many errors because you're going to be more relaxed.;8;37
12298;1gS4Hb9gpOI;1gS4Hb9gpOI-8-rgb_front;1gS4Hb9gpOI_8;1gS4Hb9gpOI_8-8-rgb_front;47.37;52.3;And if you do make an error, it'll be much easier to fix, and you just won't be all stressed out.;8;21
12299;1gS4Hb9gpOI;1gS4Hb9gpOI-8-rgb_front;1gS4Hb9gpOI_9;1gS4Hb9gpOI_9-8-rgb_front;52.3;56.95;So, definitely, be happy where you paint, and you will make a lot fewer mistakes.;8;15
12300;1gTkFzIRzYk;1gTkFzIRzYk-8-rgb_front;1gTkFzIRzYk_0;1gTkFzIRzYk_0-8-rgb_front;0.5;1.12;Hi.;8;1

12302;1gTkFzIRzYk;1gTkFzIRzYk-8-rgb_front;1gTkFzIRzYk_11;1gTkFzIRzYk_11-8-rgb_front;64.65;75.38;You can find one that matches it, switch it up a little bit, play around with it, but always stick to silver with the earrings and necklace, if that's what the color of your bracelet is.;8;36
12303;1gTkFzIRzYk;1gTkFzIRzYk-8-rgb_front;1gTkFzIRzYk_12;1gTkFzIRzYk_12-8-rgb_front;76.61;81.64;Also if you're wearing a bracelet, it's a good idea to make sure that one piece of jewelry is your stand out piece.;8;23
12304;1gTkFzIRzYk;1gTkFzIRzYk-8-rgb_front;1gTkFzIRzYk_13;1gTkFzIRzYk_13-8-rgb_front;81.64;86.91;Everything else needs to be a little bit more subtle so that the eye doesn't have conflicting interest.;8;18
12305;1gTkFzIRzYk;1gTkFzIRzYk-8-rgb_front;1gTkFzIRzYk_14;1gTkFzIRzYk_14-8-rgb_front;87.18;90.77;Finally this last watch that we have is actually made for a man.;8;13
12306;1gTkFzIRzYk;1gTkFzIRzYk-8-rgb_front;1gTkFzIRzYk_15;1gTkFzIRzYk_15-8-rgb_front;91.35;93.48;Men can wear bracelets as well as women.;8;8
12307;1gTkFzIRzYk;1gTkFzIRzYk-8-rgb_front;1gTkFzIRzYk_16;1gTkFzIRzYk_16-8-rgb_front;93.82;103.67;This one kind of resembles a watch band without the watch face on it, and can be worn in a variety of ways with a variety of outfits.;8;28
12308;1gTkFzIRzYk;1gTkFzIRzYk-8-rgb_front;1gTkFzIRzYk_17;1gTkFzIRzYk_17-8-rgb_front;104.38;107.08;Join us in the next segment and we're going to talk about anklets.;8;13
12309;1gTkFzIRzYk;1gTkFzIRzYk-8-rgb_front;1gTkFzIRzYk_2;1gTkFzIRzYk_2-8-rgb_front;3.8;7.16;We're going to talk a little bit about how to accessorize using your bracelets.;8;14
12310;1gTkFzIRzYk;1gTkFzIRzYk-8-rgb_front;1gTkFzIRzYk_3;1gTkFzIRzYk_3-8-rgb_front;8.15;13.28;The first few examples that we have are this one here.;8;11
12311;1gTkFzIRzYk;1gTkFzIRzYk-8-rgb_front;1gTkFzIRzYk_4;1gTkFzIRzYk_4-8-rgb_front;13.62;22.91;This one's a little bit fancier, and typically you would think about pairing it up with something, something more glamorous, that you'd be going out for an evening out on the town.;8;32
12312;1gTkFzIRzYk;1gTkFzIRzYk-8-rgb_front;1gTkFzIRzYk_5;1gTkFzIRzYk_5-8-rgb_front;23.71;31.74;I, on the other hand, like the mix things up a little bit, pairing up fancy, stylish things with a casual outfit.;8;22
12313;1gTkFzIRzYk;1gTkFzIRzYk-8-rgb_front;1gTkFzIRzYk_6;1gTkFzIRzYk_6-8-rgb_front;32.47;35.49;So for me, this would be something that I might want to have some fun with.;8;16
12314;1gTkFzIRzYk;1gTkFzIRzYk-8-rgb_front;1gTkFzIRzYk_7;1gTkFzIRzYk_7-8-rgb_front;38.99;42.16;Second bracelet option that we have is this one here.;8;10
12315;1gTkFzIRzYk;1gTkFzIRzYk-8-rgb_front;1gTkFzIRzYk_8;1gTkFzIRzYk_8-8-rgb_front;42.68;44.93;This is an example of a charm bracelet.;8;8
12316;1gTkFzIRzYk;1gTkFzIRzYk-8-rgb_front;1gTkFzIRzYk_9;1gTkFzIRzYk_9-8-rgb_front;45.69;49.41;And one that I can see going well with a sparkly ring.;8;12
12317;1gWf0iJUvyg;1gWf0iJUvyg-8-rgb_front;1gWf0iJUvyg_0;1gWf0iJUvyg_0-8-rgb_front;0.4;3.19;Hi, in this segment we're going to do another type of a foot brush.;8;14
12318;1gWf0iJUvyg;1gWf0iJUvyg-8-rgb_front;1gWf0iJUvyg_1;1gWf0iJUvyg_1-8-rgb_front;3.97;11.3;We call this one the Tommy kick or the Tommy brush because he's basically the guy who does it the best and it kind of got named after him.;8;29
12319;1gWf0iJUvyg;1gWf0iJUvyg-8-rgb_front;1gWf0iJUvyg_10;1gWf0iJUvyg_10-8-rgb_front;46.47;49.82;You can go into a lot of different moves after that Tommy kick.;8;13
12320;1gWf0iJUvyg;1gWf0iJUvyg-8-rgb_front;1gWf0iJUvyg_11;1gWf0iJUvyg_11-8-rgb_front;50.03;56.99;It's a great way to save a Frisbee or to pass a Frisbee or to get the Frisbee into another different part of your combination.;8;25
12321;1gWf0iJUvyg;1gWf0iJUvyg-8-rgb_front;1gWf0iJUvyg_12;1gWf0iJUvyg_12-8-rgb_front;57.17;60.35;So we'll try that one, one more time you go to clock spin.;8;13
12322;1gWf0iJUvyg;1gWf0iJUvyg-8-rgb_front;1gWf0iJUvyg_13;1gWf0iJUvyg_13-8-rgb_front;60.82;63.15;You'll set it up swing your foot across.;8;8
12323;1gWf0iJUvyg;1gWf0iJUvyg-8-rgb_front;1gWf0iJUvyg_14;1gWf0iJUvyg_14-8-rgb_front;63.64;64.51;The Tommy kick.;8;3

12325;1gWf0iJUvyg;1gWf0iJUvyg-8-rgb_front;1gWf0iJUvyg_3;1gWf0iJUvyg_3-8-rgb_front;16.86;21.28;So clockwise spin here and then I'm going to look at the bottom of the Frisbee again.;8;17
12326;1gWf0iJUvyg;1gWf0iJUvyg-8-rgb_front;1gWf0iJUvyg_4;1gWf0iJUvyg_4-8-rgb_front;21.28;26.62;I'm going to bring my foot up and I'm going to hit it with the outside of my foot bringing it back here.;8;23
12327;1gWf0iJUvyg;1gWf0iJUvyg-8-rgb_front;1gWf0iJUvyg_5;1gWf0iJUvyg_5-8-rgb_front;26.62;30.11;Swinging it across the Frisbee so it comes back up this way.;8;12
12328;1gWf0iJUvyg;1gWf0iJUvyg-8-rgb_front;1gWf0iJUvyg_6;1gWf0iJUvyg_6-8-rgb_front;30.54;34.46;So clock spin here, here.;8;5
12329;1gWf0iJUvyg;1gWf0iJUvyg-8-rgb_front;1gWf0iJUvyg_7;1gWf0iJUvyg_7-8-rgb_front;35.88;36.73;Try that again.;8;3

12333;1gXWDKek85Y;1gXWDKek85Y-8-rgb_front;1gXWDKek85Y_1;1gXWDKek85Y_1-8-rgb_front;6.88;9.29;And most pants have a tack here.;8;7

12339;1gXWDKek85Y;1gXWDKek85Y-8-rgb_front;1gXWDKek85Y_15;1gXWDKek85Y_15-8-rgb_front;39.3;41.1;Be real careful if you are using a razor blade.;8;10

12371;1gXWDKek85Y;1gXWDKek85Y-8-rgb_front;1gXWDKek85Y_45;1gXWDKek85Y_45-8-rgb_front;124.61;136.22;So, now that we have the hem undone, we're going to lay it out and in the next clip we're going to talk about the measurements and why we're going to mark it the way that we're going to mark it.;8;41
12372;1gXWDKek85Y;1gXWDKek85Y-8-rgb_front;1gXWDKek85Y_46;1gXWDKek85Y_46-8-rgb_front;136.22;138.68;So, let's do that in the next clip.;8;8
12373;1gXWDKek85Y;1gXWDKek85Y-8-rgb_front;1gXWDKek85Y_5;1gXWDKek85Y_5-8-rgb_front;16.33;17.94;You can use a seamer ripper if you want.;8;9

12375;1gXWDKek85Y;1gXWDKek85Y-8-rgb_front;1gXWDKek85Y_7;1gXWDKek85Y_7-8-rgb_front;21.37;22.31;Bring that down.;8;3
12376;1gXWDKek85Y;1gXWDKek85Y-8-rgb_front;1gXWDKek85Y_8;1gXWDKek85Y_8-8-rgb_front;22.55;24.9;You do it to all sides.;8;6

12378;1ghvkzsMgbM;1ghvkzsMgbM-8-rgb_front;1ghvkzsMgbM_0;1ghvkzsMgbM_0-8-rgb_front;0.49;5.19;Today we're going to make this beautiful vegetable flower centerpiece in crudites.;8;12
12379;1ghvkzsMgbM;1ghvkzsMgbM-8-rgb_front;1ghvkzsMgbM_1;1ghvkzsMgbM_1-8-rgb_front;5.85;12.91;Not only is it a fabulous centerpiece for your table, it is a unique way to serve your vegetable crudites.;8;20
12380;1ghvkzsMgbM;1ghvkzsMgbM-8-rgb_front;1ghvkzsMgbM_10;1ghvkzsMgbM_10-8-rgb_front;49.14;51.18;So you'll want to cut off the ends.;8;8
12381;1ghvkzsMgbM;1ghvkzsMgbM-8-rgb_front;1ghvkzsMgbM_11;1ghvkzsMgbM_11-8-rgb_front;53.17;55.71;And then you want to cut a slice.;8;8
12382;1ghvkzsMgbM;1ghvkzsMgbM-8-rgb_front;1ghvkzsMgbM_12;1ghvkzsMgbM_12-8-rgb_front;56.06;58.95;About a quarter inch slice like that.;8;7
12383;1ghvkzsMgbM;1ghvkzsMgbM-8-rgb_front;1ghvkzsMgbM_13;1ghvkzsMgbM_13-8-rgb_front;59.08;60.27;Into little rounds.;8;3
12384;1ghvkzsMgbM;1ghvkzsMgbM-8-rgb_front;1ghvkzsMgbM_14;1ghvkzsMgbM_14-8-rgb_front;61.5;65.56;You want quite a few of these because you need two for each flower.;8;14
12385;1ghvkzsMgbM;1ghvkzsMgbM-8-rgb_front;1ghvkzsMgbM_15;1ghvkzsMgbM_15-8-rgb_front;66.19;68.36;And it depends on how many flowers you want to make.;8;11
12386;1ghvkzsMgbM;1ghvkzsMgbM-8-rgb_front;1ghvkzsMgbM_16;1ghvkzsMgbM_16-8-rgb_front;68.36;72.69;If you want a nice full basket of flowers, you're going to make a lot of flowers.;8;17
12387;1ghvkzsMgbM;1ghvkzsMgbM-8-rgb_front;1ghvkzsMgbM_17;1ghvkzsMgbM_17-8-rgb_front;74.03;75.66;And then you just set those aside.;8;7
12388;1ghvkzsMgbM;1ghvkzsMgbM-8-rgb_front;1ghvkzsMgbM_18;1ghvkzsMgbM_18-8-rgb_front;76.11;81.04;And then I'll show you how to slice the root vegetables for the flower petals.;8;15
12389;1ghvkzsMgbM;1ghvkzsMgbM-8-rgb_front;1ghvkzsMgbM_2;1ghvkzsMgbM_2-8-rgb_front;13.4;17.79;The basket is stuffed full of fresh vegetable sticks ready for dipping.;8;12
12390;1ghvkzsMgbM;1ghvkzsMgbM-8-rgb_front;1ghvkzsMgbM_3;1ghvkzsMgbM_3-8-rgb_front;18.21;21.46;And the flowers are made of an assortment of root vegetables.;8;11
12391;1ghvkzsMgbM;1ghvkzsMgbM-8-rgb_front;1ghvkzsMgbM_4;1ghvkzsMgbM_4-8-rgb_front;21.7;22.58;All edible.;8;2
12392;1ghvkzsMgbM;1ghvkzsMgbM-8-rgb_front;1ghvkzsMgbM_5;1ghvkzsMgbM_5-8-rgb_front;22.93;27.8;Including sweet potatoes, turnip, radish and kohlrabi.;8;7
12393;1ghvkzsMgbM;1ghvkzsMgbM-8-rgb_front;1ghvkzsMgbM_6;1ghvkzsMgbM_6-8-rgb_front;28.06;30.53;We'll start by preparing some carrot rounds.;8;7
12394;1ghvkzsMgbM;1ghvkzsMgbM-8-rgb_front;1ghvkzsMgbM_7;1ghvkzsMgbM_7-8-rgb_front;30.89;32.67;You want to peel some carrots up.;8;7
12395;1ghvkzsMgbM;1ghvkzsMgbM-8-rgb_front;1ghvkzsMgbM_8;1ghvkzsMgbM_8-8-rgb_front;32.67;36.78;You want to use some skinny ones and some fat ones.;8;11
12396;1ghvkzsMgbM;1ghvkzsMgbM-8-rgb_front;1ghvkzsMgbM_9;1ghvkzsMgbM_9-8-rgb_front;37.69;47.61;So we'll peel those and then we're going to cut a whole bunch of little rounds that we'll use for making our flowers.;8;23
12397;1gjp23WV368;1gjp23WV368-8-rgb_front;1gjp23WV368_0;1gjp23WV368_0-8-rgb_front;0.51;6.86;So after you have both your synch and asynch four club fountains together, you might want to think about switching in between them without stopping.;8;25
12398;1gjp23WV368;1gjp23WV368-8-rgb_front;1gjp23WV368_1;1gjp23WV368_1-8-rgb_front;7.4;11.3;Now this is a pretty cool visual effect, but it will take a lot of time and a lot of practice.;8;21
12399;1gjp23WV368;1gjp23WV368-8-rgb_front;1gjp23WV368_2;1gjp23WV368_2-8-rgb_front;11.84;22.21;So if you start with your asynch pattern, what you're going to do, is you're going to take your strong hand and you're going to throw a triple throw, and leave all other throws exactly the same.;8;37
12400;1gjp23WV368;1gjp23WV368-8-rgb_front;1gjp23WV368_3;1gjp23WV368_3-8-rgb_front;22.56;31.87;So what this will do is it will delay your right hand by one beat, thereby putting it into the same pattern as your left and moving you into synchrous.;8;30
12401;1gjp23WV368;1gjp23WV368-8-rgb_front;1gjp23WV368_4;1gjp23WV368_4-8-rgb_front;32.47;33.63;It looks something like this.;8;5
12402;1gjp23WV368;1gjp23WV368-8-rgb_front;1gjp23WV368_5;1gjp23WV368_5-8-rgb_front;36.25;46.24;Here we're in asynch, we'll make a triple throw out of our left hand and keep all other throws the same, and it puts you into synch.;8;27
12403;1gjp23WV368;1gjp23WV368-8-rgb_front;1gjp23WV368_6;1gjp23WV368_6-8-rgb_front;47.72;60.22;Now to get out of synch, to go back to asynch, you're going to do the exact same thing, you're going to delay your hand by one beat, but this will put you into asynch, just like that.;8;38
12404;1gjp23WV368;1gjp23WV368-8-rgb_front;1gjp23WV368_7;1gjp23WV368_7-8-rgb_front;60.54;62.14;Hopefully you don't drop like I just did.;8;8
12405;1gjp23WV368;1gjp23WV368-8-rgb_front;1gjp23WV368_8;1gjp23WV368_8-8-rgb_front;63.07;75.39;But again, so you can see how that works, we'll be in synch, a triple throw puts us right back into asynch.;8;22
12406;1gjp23WV368;1gjp23WV368-8-rgb_front;1gjp23WV368_9;1gjp23WV368_9-8-rgb_front;76.01;83.47;Now that triple throw can be pretty hard to execute it sometimes, but you just have to really think about isolating your right and left hands, getting a triple and a double, and it should all work out!;8;38
12407;1glVsfq3zG8;1glVsfq3zG8-8-rgb_front;1glVsfq3zG8_0;1glVsfq3zG8_0-8-rgb_front;0.05;5.72;The first thing we need to look at is actually getting the glass melted before we start making beads.;8;19
12408;1glVsfq3zG8;1glVsfq3zG8-8-rgb_front;1glVsfq3zG8_1;1glVsfq3zG8_1-8-rgb_front;5.99;17.19;"You need to be very careful when you melt glass because if you heat glass up too quickly it's just like dropping an ice cube into a hot glass of tea, it will shatter very quickly; it's called thermo-shocking.";8;39
12409;1glVsfq3zG8;1glVsfq3zG8-8-rgb_front;1glVsfq3zG8_2;1glVsfq3zG8_2-8-rgb_front;17.61;29.6;So with a piece of glass with a diameter this large you want to make sure that you introduce it into the flame very, very slowly, and you start at the back end of the flame, about six inches out from the head of the torch.;8;46
12410;1glVsfq3zG8;1glVsfq3zG8-8-rgb_front;1glVsfq3zG8_3;1glVsfq3zG8_3-8-rgb_front;32.23;37.81;So remember, the thicker the diameter of your glass, the more slowly you're going to have to introduce it to the flame.;8;22
12411;1glVsfq3zG8;1glVsfq3zG8-8-rgb_front;1glVsfq3zG8_4;1glVsfq3zG8_4-8-rgb_front;38.52;46.62;As this glass starts to heat up and gets to the point that it's malleable enough to work, it'll start to get an orange glow to the tip.;8;28
12412;1glVsfq3zG8;1glVsfq3zG8-8-rgb_front;1glVsfq3zG8_5;1glVsfq3zG8_5-8-rgb_front;51.31;57.64;As the orange increases going down the tube you can then bring the glass closer and closer to the head of the torch.;8;23
12413;1glVsfq3zG8;1glVsfq3zG8-8-rgb_front;1glVsfq3zG8_6;1glVsfq3zG8_6-8-rgb_front;58.03;61.81;You never want to work closer than about two inches to the head of the torch.;8;16
12414;1glVsfq3zG8;1glVsfq3zG8-8-rgb_front;1glVsfq3zG8_7;1glVsfq3zG8_7-8-rgb_front;68.5;80.88;So now you can begin to see the tip is orange, you introduce more of the glass, and as you want to make sure that as you're heating the glass you keep rotating the rod in your hand.;8;38
12415;1glVsfq3zG8;1glVsfq3zG8-8-rgb_front;1glVsfq3zG8_8;1glVsfq3zG8_8-8-rgb_front;82.35;96.84;As you continue to heat, the orange color will spread, and eventually the glass is going to become the consistency of warm honey, and it's going to start to droop when you hold the rod still.;8;36
12416;1glVsfq3zG8;1glVsfq3zG8-8-rgb_front;1glVsfq3zG8_9;1glVsfq3zG8_9-8-rgb_front;97.42;100.94;When you have this droop, it's finally time to work your glass.;8;12

12473;1h0-Yi_Swbw;1h0-Yi_Swbw-8-rgb_front;1h0-Yi_Swbw_10;1h0-Yi_Swbw_10-8-rgb_front;76.57;100.51;Second step, is to do some accounting, and figure out how much money, that product or service generates, what expenses are associated with it, and have that separated out, so that a buyer can accurately see, what those numbers are, so that a value can be developed from that, and those are some first steps, to thinking about how to sell part of your business.;8;65
12474;1h0-Yi_Swbw;1h0-Yi_Swbw-8-rgb_front;1h0-Yi_Swbw_2;1h0-Yi_Swbw_2-8-rgb_front;8.73;16.43;Before you start thinking about selling part, ask yourself, what are my goals, my objectives for wanting to sell part of the business?;8;23
12475;1h0-Yi_Swbw;1h0-Yi_Swbw-8-rgb_front;1h0-Yi_Swbw_3;1h0-Yi_Swbw_3-8-rgb_front;16.97;19.24;What will I be getting for that?;8;7
12476;1h0-Yi_Swbw;1h0-Yi_Swbw-8-rgb_front;1h0-Yi_Swbw_4;1h0-Yi_Swbw_4-8-rgb_front;19.24;23.55;Most small businesses are sold as a complete asset sale.;8;10
12477;1h0-Yi_Swbw;1h0-Yi_Swbw-8-rgb_front;1h0-Yi_Swbw_5;1h0-Yi_Swbw_5-8-rgb_front;23.55;26.57;We don't usually sell just part of the business, but let's say you did.;8;14
12478;1h0-Yi_Swbw;1h0-Yi_Swbw-8-rgb_front;1h0-Yi_Swbw_6;1h0-Yi_Swbw_6-8-rgb_front;27.61;35.58;One of the things that the buyer would want to see, is what is the value of this part of your business?;8;22
12479;1h0-Yi_Swbw;1h0-Yi_Swbw-8-rgb_front;1h0-Yi_Swbw_7;1h0-Yi_Swbw_7-8-rgb_front;35.91;61.34;So if you do have a separate division of your business, or a product line that you do want to sell, it's really crucial to represent that accurately, in terms, of how much revenue does that product generate, and what the expenses are associated with that product, or different division of the company, so that you can fully represent, what exactly you're trying to sell.;8;65
12480;1h0-Yi_Swbw;1h0-Yi_Swbw-8-rgb_front;1h0-Yi_Swbw_8;1h0-Yi_Swbw_8-8-rgb_front;62.18;73.12;Basically, you want the buyer to be able to have a transparent view of what they're buying, so before you want to sell part of your business, or a product line, or something like that.;8;35
12481;1h0-Yi_Swbw;1h0-Yi_Swbw-8-rgb_front;1h0-Yi_Swbw_9;1h0-Yi_Swbw_9-8-rgb_front;73.56;76.57;The first step is to understand why you want to sell it.;8;12
12482;1h1YkisCV_A;1h1YkisCV_A-8-rgb_front;1h1YkisCV_A_1;1h1YkisCV_A_1-8-rgb_front;9.27;28.72;Now I have several hands laid out here, like we are playing 3 card poker so just kind of look at me in increments of 3, we're going to start over here this is a pair of deuces with a ten kicker, and this is the pair plus this is pertaining to the pair plus.;8;55
12483;1h1YkisCV_A;1h1YkisCV_A-8-rgb_front;1h1YkisCV_A_2;1h1YkisCV_A_2-8-rgb_front;29.18;37.56;Let's say you have a dollar on the pair plus and you have a pair in your hand, your going to get paid even money so your going to make a dollar.;8;32
12484;1h1YkisCV_A;1h1YkisCV_A-8-rgb_front;1h1YkisCV_A_3;1h1YkisCV_A_3-8-rgb_front;37.93;50.18;So they're going to pay you a dollar and this is just for the pair, we're going to the next one which is a flush and on the flush your going to get paid for to 1, so if you have a dollar you get paid $4.;8;47
12485;1h1YkisCV_A;1h1YkisCV_A-8-rgb_front;1h1YkisCV_A_4;1h1YkisCV_A_4-8-rgb_front;51.35;64.58;Moving on to the next one this is a straight, 7, 8, 9 in this section you got a straight your going to get paid 6 to 1 on that, so if you put a dollar up, your going to get paid $6 on your dollar.;8;46
12486;1h1YkisCV_A;1h1YkisCV_A-8-rgb_front;1h1YkisCV_A_5;1h1YkisCV_A_5-8-rgb_front;65.07;75.65;This is three of a kind, we have three aces here, three any of the same card, you know this is where you start making some good money here, if you put a dollar up, your going to get paid 30 to 1 on that.;8;45
12487;1h1YkisCV_A;1h1YkisCV_A-8-rgb_front;1h1YkisCV_A_6;1h1YkisCV_A_6-8-rgb_front;75.73;77.89;So you make 30 bucks on that dollar.;8;8
12488;1h1YkisCV_A;1h1YkisCV_A-8-rgb_front;1h1YkisCV_A_7;1h1YkisCV_A_7-8-rgb_front;78.64;99.64;This is where you really get this is a straight flush, three cards same suit in a row, that is 40 to 1, so if you got paid a dollar you got 40 bucks, if you get a little fistey start putting a little bit more money you can make some serious money if you get a straight flush but it is very rare occurrence that your going to get a straight flush or even a straight.;8;77
12489;1h1YkisCV_A;1h1YkisCV_A-8-rgb_front;1h1YkisCV_A_8;1h1YkisCV_A_8-8-rgb_front;99.64;106.87;That is why they pay 40, 30 to 1, so these are all the pair plus hands.;8;17
12490;1h1YkisCV_A;1h1YkisCV_A-8-rgb_front;1h1YkisCV_A_9;1h1YkisCV_A_9-8-rgb_front;107.58;108.62;Thank you for watching.;8;4

12492;1h3mvQDZnBw;1h3mvQDZnBw-8-rgb_front;1h3mvQDZnBw_10;1h3mvQDZnBw_10-8-rgb_front;56.37;58.58;"So I write on here ""one quarter inch.""";8;8
12493;1h3mvQDZnBw;1h3mvQDZnBw-8-rgb_front;1h3mvQDZnBw_11;1h3mvQDZnBw_11-8-rgb_front;59.16;62.3;Now I'm going to back this up one quarter inch.;8;10
12494;1h3mvQDZnBw;1h3mvQDZnBw-8-rgb_front;1h3mvQDZnBw_12;1h3mvQDZnBw_12-8-rgb_front;62.86;67.35;"So it makes it real simple; the only number I need to know is three and seven eighths.";8;18
12495;1h3mvQDZnBw;1h3mvQDZnBw-8-rgb_front;1h3mvQDZnBw_13;1h3mvQDZnBw_13-8-rgb_front;68.01;72.57;So, I've backed it up a quarter inch for the inside mat and I've laid this out.;8;17
12496;1h3mvQDZnBw;1h3mvQDZnBw-8-rgb_front;1h3mvQDZnBw_14;1h3mvQDZnBw_14-8-rgb_front;77.35;85.11;Again, I know that my side margins are going to be a little bit different, so I put my finger on twenty, which is the size of the frame.;8;29
12497;1h3mvQDZnBw;1h3mvQDZnBw-8-rgb_front;1h3mvQDZnBw_15;1h3mvQDZnBw_15-8-rgb_front;85.77;87.93;And, it's actually nine and a quarter.;8;7
12498;1h3mvQDZnBw;1h3mvQDZnBw-8-rgb_front;1h3mvQDZnBw_16;1h3mvQDZnBw_16-8-rgb_front;87.93;92.48;So, half of that is four and five eighths.;8;9
12499;1h3mvQDZnBw;1h3mvQDZnBw-8-rgb_front;1h3mvQDZnBw_17;1h3mvQDZnBw_17-8-rgb_front;93.22;104.58;So, we put my mat guide on four and five eighths, we back it up for that quarter inch on the inside and now we lay this out.;8;28
12500;1h3mvQDZnBw;1h3mvQDZnBw-8-rgb_front;1h3mvQDZnBw_18;1h3mvQDZnBw_18-8-rgb_front;111.31;113.89;Okay, so I've put my mat into the mat cutter.;8;10
12501;1h3mvQDZnBw;1h3mvQDZnBw-8-rgb_front;1h3mvQDZnBw_19;1h3mvQDZnBw_19-8-rgb_front;114.67;118.45;This particular mat cutter cuts on a forty five.;8;9
12502;1h3mvQDZnBw;1h3mvQDZnBw-8-rgb_front;1h3mvQDZnBw_2;1h3mvQDZnBw_2-8-rgb_front;12.78;16.07;So, again, this particular one we did it larger.;8;9
12503;1h3mvQDZnBw;1h3mvQDZnBw-8-rgb_front;1h3mvQDZnBw_20;1h3mvQDZnBw_20-8-rgb_front;118.83;122.94;I've put the mat in about an eighth of an inch past the line.;8;14
12504;1h3mvQDZnBw;1h3mvQDZnBw-8-rgb_front;1h3mvQDZnBw_21;1h3mvQDZnBw_21-8-rgb_front;123.76;126.38;I come down about an eighth of an inch past the line.;8;12
12505;1h3mvQDZnBw;1h3mvQDZnBw-8-rgb_front;1h3mvQDZnBw_22;1h3mvQDZnBw_22-8-rgb_front;127.12;143.67;I move my bottom board here every single time so that when this blade goes through and makes a cut, it doesn't go and make a cut through the same line, which would make my cut on the mat not be nice and straight.;8;44
12506;1h3mvQDZnBw;1h3mvQDZnBw-8-rgb_front;1h3mvQDZnBw_23;1h3mvQDZnBw_23-8-rgb_front;145.61;159.14;Okay, now sometimes, the mat does not just fall out like it did the last time.;8;16
12507;1h3mvQDZnBw;1h3mvQDZnBw-8-rgb_front;1h3mvQDZnBw_24;1h3mvQDZnBw_24-8-rgb_front;159.33;170.22;So, what we do is we take a little razor blade and we pick this up, because we don't want it to rip and then it won't make a beautiful corner.;8;31
12508;1h3mvQDZnBw;1h3mvQDZnBw-8-rgb_front;1h3mvQDZnBw_25;1h3mvQDZnBw_25-8-rgb_front;171.08;173.18;That's all it took was one little tiny nip.;8;9
12509;1h3mvQDZnBw;1h3mvQDZnBw-8-rgb_front;1h3mvQDZnBw_3;1h3mvQDZnBw_3-8-rgb_front;16.1;18.16;We are going to do a sixteen by twenty.;8;9
12510;1h3mvQDZnBw;1h3mvQDZnBw-8-rgb_front;1h3mvQDZnBw_4;1h3mvQDZnBw_4-8-rgb_front;18.78;24.28;So, what we are going to do is take the top mat (the one that you see the most of) and we are going to cut that first.;8;28
12511;1h3mvQDZnBw;1h3mvQDZnBw-8-rgb_front;1h3mvQDZnBw_5;1h3mvQDZnBw_5-8-rgb_front;24.94;31.37;So, we take our tape measure and we are going to measure to find out what our margins are going to be.;8;22
12512;1h3mvQDZnBw;1h3mvQDZnBw-8-rgb_front;1h3mvQDZnBw_6;1h3mvQDZnBw_6-8-rgb_front;32.3;39.56;So, this frame is a sixteen by twenty, so we see that it is seven and three quarters.;8;18
12513;1h3mvQDZnBw;1h3mvQDZnBw-8-rgb_front;1h3mvQDZnBw_7;1h3mvQDZnBw_7-8-rgb_front;39.56;42.65;So, half of that is three and seven eighths.;8;9
12514;1h3mvQDZnBw;1h3mvQDZnBw-8-rgb_front;1h3mvQDZnBw_8;1h3mvQDZnBw_8-8-rgb_front;43.25;47.31;But, remember that we have another mat to put underneath it and this is the top mat.;8;17
12515;1h3mvQDZnBw;1h3mvQDZnBw-8-rgb_front;1h3mvQDZnBw_9;1h3mvQDZnBw_9-8-rgb_front;48.06;55.91;So, what we do is, first we put it on three and seven eighths and we decide that I'm going to use a quarter of an inch of the inside color.;8;31
12567;1hpps7Dqdio;1hpps7Dqdio-8-rgb_front;1hpps7Dqdio_0;1hpps7Dqdio_0-8-rgb_front;1.55;5.79;Your skin is your largest organ and it will absorb any chemicals we put on it.;8;16

12584;1i3DinytEDE;1i3DinytEDE-8-rgb_front;1i3DinytEDE_10;1i3DinytEDE_10-8-rgb_front;59.68;61.63;So that is four movements you have just learned.;8;9
12585;1i3DinytEDE;1i3DinytEDE-8-rgb_front;1i3DinytEDE_2;1i3DinytEDE_2-8-rgb_front;9.87;15.88;It is actually the same kick but we are going to add a little bit more by bringing our arms out.;8;21
12586;1i3DinytEDE;1i3DinytEDE-8-rgb_front;1i3DinytEDE_3;1i3DinytEDE_3-8-rgb_front;16.48;17.74;You see these muscles.;8;4

12590;1i3DinytEDE;1i3DinytEDE-8-rgb_front;1i3DinytEDE_7;1i3DinytEDE_7-8-rgb_front;40.94;44.89;You have to have some serious control and then back.;8;10

12605;1iJg1Tm5Q1w;1iJg1Tm5Q1w-8-rgb_front;1iJg1Tm5Q1w_9;1iJg1Tm5Q1w_9-8-rgb_front;80.88;91.94;The second type is a free, it's a free standing clamp, which is not connected at all, you just hold it, you just clamp it to the different edges of your racket to string.;8;34

12651;1ib_NnOrt6A;1ib_NnOrt6A-8-rgb_front;1ib_NnOrt6A_12;1ib_NnOrt6A_12-8-rgb_front;73.13;74.57;So you want to get rid of those.;8;8

12658;1ib_NnOrt6A;1ib_NnOrt6A-8-rgb_front;1ib_NnOrt6A_19;1ib_NnOrt6A_19-8-rgb_front;118.33;126.37;Because there could be a full chest that I really want to get rid of but if I don't look in it I'm going to forget that I have these things.;8;31

12660;1ib_NnOrt6A;1ib_NnOrt6A-8-rgb_front;1ib_NnOrt6A_20;1ib_NnOrt6A_20-8-rgb_front;126.37;142.08;So if I'm going to the trouble of having a garage sale or doing all this you really want to go through and pull out all the drawers, boxes, take the tops off and look to see what you have where you won't miss anything.;8;45
12661;1ib_NnOrt6A;1ib_NnOrt6A-8-rgb_front;1ib_NnOrt6A_21;1ib_NnOrt6A_21-8-rgb_front;142.24;145.49;This is Ann Myrick and that is how to get rid of what you don't want.;8;16

12663;1ib_NnOrt6A;1ib_NnOrt6A-8-rgb_front;1ib_NnOrt6A_4;1ib_NnOrt6A_4-8-rgb_front;27.42;29.12;I would write down each room.;8;6

12666;1ib_NnOrt6A;1ib_NnOrt6A-8-rgb_front;1ib_NnOrt6A_7;1ib_NnOrt6A_7-8-rgb_front;35.31;39.27;Do you want to, there's probably going to be several different ways.;8;12

Or there's also probably going to be a box or could be a box, if you want to make a little extra money, for a garage sale.;8;46
12687;1ikV8IVFpBw;1ikV8IVFpBw-8-rgb_front;1ikV8IVFpBw_0;1ikV8IVFpBw_0-8-rgb_front;0.43;2.66;All right now we are going to start applying mud.;8;10
12688;1ikV8IVFpBw;1ikV8IVFpBw-8-rgb_front;1ikV8IVFpBw_1;1ikV8IVFpBw_1-8-rgb_front;2.9;7.23;Now the first step in applying mud is making sure we put tape on all the joints and cracks.;8;19

12691;1ikV8IVFpBw;1ikV8IVFpBw-8-rgb_front;1ikV8IVFpBw_3;1ikV8IVFpBw_3-8-rgb_front;16.91;18.01;So here we go.;8;4

12700;1imaK8eDk5Q;1imaK8eDk5Q-8-rgb_front;1imaK8eDk5Q_10;1imaK8eDk5Q_10-8-rgb_front;70.5;78.77;Do a variety of different exercises, as your abdominal and mid section, as well as your core, is used in almost everything that you do, it gets trained frequently throughout the day.;8;32
12701;1imaK8eDk5Q;1imaK8eDk5Q-8-rgb_front;1imaK8eDk5Q_11;1imaK8eDk5Q_11-8-rgb_front;79.13;85.08;So take time, focus, add that healthy diet, as well as regular exercise to your routine, to achieve that nice slim waist.;8;22
12702;1imaK8eDk5Q;1imaK8eDk5Q-8-rgb_front;1imaK8eDk5Q_2;1imaK8eDk5Q_2-8-rgb_front;5.12;12.24;The waist or the mid section, abdominals, or commonly called the core, can be slimmed in several different ways.;8;19
12703;1imaK8eDk5Q;1imaK8eDk5Q-8-rgb_front;1imaK8eDk5Q_3;1imaK8eDk5Q_3-8-rgb_front;12.86;19.19;Most importantly by minimizing the amount of body fat that's covering the musculature of the structure itself.;8;17
12704;1imaK8eDk5Q;1imaK8eDk5Q-8-rgb_front;1imaK8eDk5Q_4;1imaK8eDk5Q_4-8-rgb_front;19.59;25.0;Toning the muscles and keeping the muscles tight will help pull them in, so they act like a natural girdle for the body.;8;23
12705;1imaK8eDk5Q;1imaK8eDk5Q-8-rgb_front;1imaK8eDk5Q_5;1imaK8eDk5Q_5-8-rgb_front;25.43;33.44;Reducing the amount of body fat overlying that tissue would help again, slim that area, to give it overall appearance of a leaner, stronger mid section.;8;26
12706;1imaK8eDk5Q;1imaK8eDk5Q-8-rgb_front;1imaK8eDk5Q_6;1imaK8eDk5Q_6-8-rgb_front;33.82;56.28;By strengthening and toning the rest of the muscles of your body will give you a nice overall V-shape look, which gives you nice strong shoulders and upper body, a good balanced lower body for strength and development there, but then maximizing that narrow waist by modifying your diet, so that it's overall adding to your health, as well as increasing your level of activity to achieve maximum results.;8;69
12707;1imaK8eDk5Q;1imaK8eDk5Q-8-rgb_front;1imaK8eDk5Q_7;1imaK8eDk5Q_7-8-rgb_front;56.62;62.59;Spend time doing abdominal exercises that target all aspects, moving the core and training the core as one.;8;18

12741;1jAFRRkU4ic;1jAFRRkU4ic-8-rgb_front;1jAFRRkU4ic_1;1jAFRRkU4ic_1-8-rgb_front;6.69;12.35;All the frames that you buy that are stained will have a more or less glossy finish on them.;8;19
12742;1jAFRRkU4ic;1jAFRRkU4ic-8-rgb_front;1jAFRRkU4ic_10;1jAFRRkU4ic_10-8-rgb_front;63.43;75.35;Once that's done you just take, a damp paper towel is fine, and just lightly brush it all off to get off the sand that you just created.;8;28
12743;1jAFRRkU4ic;1jAFRRkU4ic-8-rgb_front;1jAFRRkU4ic_11;1jAFRRkU4ic_11-8-rgb_front;76.04;78.8;The varnish and the dirt and that type of thing.;8;10
12744;1jAFRRkU4ic;1jAFRRkU4ic-8-rgb_front;1jAFRRkU4ic_12;1jAFRRkU4ic_12-8-rgb_front;79.07;81.38;Because you don't want that mixed into your paint.;8;9
12745;1jAFRRkU4ic;1jAFRRkU4ic-8-rgb_front;1jAFRRkU4ic_13;1jAFRRkU4ic_13-8-rgb_front;81.94;91.81;So you just make sure that you wipe all of the grooves off like this so it's clean everywhere that you're going to paint.;8;24
12746;1jAFRRkU4ic;1jAFRRkU4ic-8-rgb_front;1jAFRRkU4ic_14;1jAFRRkU4ic_14-8-rgb_front;92.42;94.4;And then let it dry for a few minutes.;8;9
12747;1jAFRRkU4ic;1jAFRRkU4ic-8-rgb_front;1jAFRRkU4ic_15;1jAFRRkU4ic_15-8-rgb_front;94.8;97.53;You can wipe it off to get any extra moisture.;8;10
12748;1jAFRRkU4ic;1jAFRRkU4ic-8-rgb_front;1jAFRRkU4ic_16;1jAFRRkU4ic_16-8-rgb_front;98.19;103.93;But then you might want to wait just a few minutes for that to completely dry before you paint.;8;19
12749;1jAFRRkU4ic;1jAFRRkU4ic-8-rgb_front;1jAFRRkU4ic_2;1jAFRRkU4ic_2-8-rgb_front;12.86;19.46;To avoid having to use a primer on this particular project all you need to do is take a medium sandpaper.;8;21
12750;1jAFRRkU4ic;1jAFRRkU4ic-8-rgb_front;1jAFRRkU4ic_3;1jAFRRkU4ic_3-8-rgb_front;20.47;23.54;I think this one is number 5.;8;7
12751;1jAFRRkU4ic;1jAFRRkU4ic-8-rgb_front;1jAFRRkU4ic_4;1jAFRRkU4ic_4-8-rgb_front;24.61;30.16;Anyway you just take it and you just sand the areas that you're going to be painting.;8;17
12752;1jAFRRkU4ic;1jAFRRkU4ic-8-rgb_front;1jAFRRkU4ic_5;1jAFRRkU4ic_5-8-rgb_front;30.21;35.04;And it's okay if you sand some of that paint off because you're base coat will take care of that.;8;20
12753;1jAFRRkU4ic;1jAFRRkU4ic-8-rgb_front;1jAFRRkU4ic_6;1jAFRRkU4ic_6-8-rgb_front;35.82;42.19;Just make sure that you sand anywhere that it's still shiny just to give you an idea of how this goes.;8;21
12754;1jAFRRkU4ic;1jAFRRkU4ic-8-rgb_front;1jAFRRkU4ic_7;1jAFRRkU4ic_7-8-rgb_front;44.12;48.02;And again, something like this you have a lot more detail to work with.;8;14
12755;1jAFRRkU4ic;1jAFRRkU4ic-8-rgb_front;1jAFRRkU4ic_8;1jAFRRkU4ic_8-8-rgb_front;48.26;50.24;That's another thing you might want to keep in mind.;8;10
12756;1jAFRRkU4ic;1jAFRRkU4ic-8-rgb_front;1jAFRRkU4ic_9;1jAFRRkU4ic_9-8-rgb_front;50.77;62.83;If you need to sand something like the other frame with the pewter you might want to mask off any off the molding that you do not want sanded and then just proceed to sand and rough up the surface.;8;40
12757;1jIxTnChOXk;1jIxTnChOXk-8-rgb_front;1jIxTnChOXk_0;1jIxTnChOXk_0-8-rgb_front;0.12;1.63;I'm Ivan Madar.;8;3
12758;1jIxTnChOXk;1jIxTnChOXk-8-rgb_front;1jIxTnChOXk_2;1jIxTnChOXk_2-8-rgb_front;7.34;14.31;"Those are the basic principles; wider stance, hands to the side.";8;11
12759;1jIxTnChOXk;1jIxTnChOXk-8-rgb_front;1jIxTnChOXk_3;1jIxTnChOXk_3-8-rgb_front;14.93;18.75;The next thing is going to be position and angles of my main joints.;8;14
12760;1jIxTnChOXk;1jIxTnChOXk-8-rgb_front;1jIxTnChOXk_4;1jIxTnChOXk_4-8-rgb_front;19.29;30.98;The joints, again, from the side, would be the ankle (this flexion), your knees, and hips.;8;16
12761;1jIxTnChOXk;1jIxTnChOXk-8-rgb_front;1jIxTnChOXk_5;1jIxTnChOXk_5-8-rgb_front;33.1;35.43;Now, what is the ideal stance?;8;6
12762;1jIxTnChOXk;1jIxTnChOXk-8-rgb_front;1jIxTnChOXk_6;1jIxTnChOXk_6-8-rgb_front;35.49;43.5;Again, the ideal stance is when the pressure goes down on your feet rather than going forward or going backward.;8;20
12763;1jIxTnChOXk;1jIxTnChOXk-8-rgb_front;1jIxTnChOXk_7;1jIxTnChOXk_7-8-rgb_front;43.82;53.36;So, we slightly flex our ankles, push our knees forward and are slightly flexed at our hips with our hands to the side.;8;23
12764;1jIxTnChOXk;1jIxTnChOXk-8-rgb_front;1jIxTnChOXk_8;1jIxTnChOXk_8-8-rgb_front;53.87;55.72;Now, this is still comfortable here.;8;6
12765;1jIxTnChOXk;1jIxTnChOXk-8-rgb_front;1jIxTnChOXk_9;1jIxTnChOXk_9-8-rgb_front;55.72;66.03;If you bounce in this position, that is the position in which you will do a lot of the either the beginner or advanced drills in skiing.;8;27

12767;1jJ4Ez4wy1g;1jJ4Ez4wy1g-8-rgb_front;1jJ4Ez4wy1g_1;1jJ4Ez4wy1g_1-8-rgb_front;4.82;10.91;The first thing we're going to use is some foundation primer to help our foundation stay on a lot better.;8;20
12768;1jJ4Ez4wy1g;1jJ4Ez4wy1g-8-rgb_front;1jJ4Ez4wy1g_2;1jJ4Ez4wy1g_2-8-rgb_front;11.39;23.26;We're actually going to mix together a liquid highlighter and our liquid foundation to give the skin a really nice dewy glow.;8;22
12769;1jJ4Ez4wy1g;1jJ4Ez4wy1g-8-rgb_front;1jJ4Ez4wy1g_3;1jJ4Ez4wy1g_3-8-rgb_front;25.64;32.16;We're going to use some bronzer mixed with some peach blush.;8;11
12770;1jJ4Ez4wy1g;1jJ4Ez4wy1g-8-rgb_front;1jJ4Ez4wy1g_4;1jJ4Ez4wy1g_4-8-rgb_front;34.03;42.87;For the eyes we're going to mix together some liners, we're going to mix together a bronze and a plum liner.;8;21

12772;1jREUW8hcAY;1jREUW8hcAY-8-rgb_front;1jREUW8hcAY_1;1jREUW8hcAY_1-8-rgb_front;6.67;11.65;Basically the easiest way to remember what to do is to look at the acronym for acne.;8;17
12773;1jREUW8hcAY;1jREUW8hcAY-8-rgb_front;1jREUW8hcAY_10;1jREUW8hcAY_10-8-rgb_front;75.04;79.82;It is going to lead to inflammation and it is going to lead to scarring but you do want to make sure that exfoliate.;8;24
12774;1jREUW8hcAY;1jREUW8hcAY-8-rgb_front;1jREUW8hcAY_11;1jREUW8hcAY_11-8-rgb_front;79.82;92.87;Anybody with acneic skin produces up to four times the amount of dead skin cells of the person with average skin so you want to definitely make sure that you use a lot of exfoliating products.;8;36
12775;1jREUW8hcAY;1jREUW8hcAY-8-rgb_front;1jREUW8hcAY_12;1jREUW8hcAY_12-8-rgb_front;92.87;102.79;I like to use salicylic acid for those types of exfoliation because chemical exfoliants helps keep the pores really nice and clean and helps to control the oil and are nonirritating.;8;31
12776;1jREUW8hcAY;1jREUW8hcAY-8-rgb_front;1jREUW8hcAY_13;1jREUW8hcAY_13-8-rgb_front;103.18;105.96;So those are some things you can do for clear skin.;8;11
12777;1jREUW8hcAY;1jREUW8hcAY-8-rgb_front;1jREUW8hcAY_2;1jREUW8hcAY_2-8-rgb_front;11.68;19.22;Basically what you want to do is make sure you are using antibacterial products, make sure you are using a really good antibacterial cleanser.;8;24
12778;1jREUW8hcAY;1jREUW8hcAY-8-rgb_front;1jREUW8hcAY_3;1jREUW8hcAY_3-8-rgb_front;19.47;28.18;Basically what causes acne is when you have dirt and debris and oil clogged within a pore and it becomes infected by that P.acne bacteria.;8;25
12779;1jREUW8hcAY;1jREUW8hcAY-8-rgb_front;1jREUW8hcAY_4;1jREUW8hcAY_4-8-rgb_front;28.45;35.76;So just by using antibacterial products to help to kill that P.acne bacteria you are going to lessen the likelihood of breakout.;8;22
12780;1jREUW8hcAY;1jREUW8hcAY-8-rgb_front;1jREUW8hcAY_5;1jREUW8hcAY_5-8-rgb_front;36.08;57.25;You also want to use oil controlling products typically acneic skin is caused from an over production of oil so just by using oil free products, hydrating products and products like something like microsponging it or something that is going to be oil controlling definitely help.;8;46
12781;1jREUW8hcAY;1jREUW8hcAY-8-rgb_front;1jREUW8hcAY_6;1jREUW8hcAY_6-8-rgb_front;57.52;60.29;Salicylic acid is a really great ingredient for that as well.;8;11
12782;1jREUW8hcAY;1jREUW8hcAY-8-rgb_front;1jREUW8hcAY_7;1jREUW8hcAY_7-8-rgb_front;60.95;63.15;You also want to use nonirritating products.;8;7
12783;1jREUW8hcAY;1jREUW8hcAY-8-rgb_front;1jREUW8hcAY_8;1jREUW8hcAY_8-8-rgb_front;63.15;73.53;You never want to use anything that is abrasive on the skin or anything that is going to overstrip the skin or you never want to scrub over an open blemish.;8;31
12784;1jREUW8hcAY;1jREUW8hcAY-8-rgb_front;1jREUW8hcAY_9;1jREUW8hcAY_9-8-rgb_front;73.56;75.04;That is just going to spread the bacteria.;8;8

12803;1jWbf4jhzGA;1jWbf4jhzGA-8-rgb_front;1jWbf4jhzGA_10;1jWbf4jhzGA_10-8-rgb_front;86.54;89.39;I'll show you how you snap this side in and then we'll be done.;8;14
12804;1jWbf4jhzGA;1jWbf4jhzGA-8-rgb_front;1jWbf4jhzGA_2;1jWbf4jhzGA_2-8-rgb_front;11.88;29.87;What I've done is I've just losing them up so they slide back and forth because I want to mount the door and make sure that it fits correctly, and then we're going to go ahead and adjust these to where we want them, and then we go ahead and retighten the screws.;8;53
12805;1jWbf4jhzGA;1jWbf4jhzGA-8-rgb_front;1jWbf4jhzGA_3;1jWbf4jhzGA_3-8-rgb_front;32.57;38.39;First thing you want to do is get your top one in over here.;8;14
12806;1jWbf4jhzGA;1jWbf4jhzGA-8-rgb_front;1jWbf4jhzGA_4;1jWbf4jhzGA_4-8-rgb_front;40.01;55.62;This pin is going to go into this hole because you want to make sure to get that pin in like so and then your bottom one into the little triangle.;8;31
12807;1jWbf4jhzGA;1jWbf4jhzGA-8-rgb_front;1jWbf4jhzGA_5_6_7;1jWbf4jhzGA_5_6_7-8-rgb_front;57.91;73.85;You may have to use your hand to feel that it is in. Okay. But there it is in and you going to see that our door isn't fitting so we're going to have to adjust our brackets on either side that's why I left them loose.;8;47
12808;1jWbf4jhzGA;1jWbf4jhzGA-8-rgb_front;1jWbf4jhzGA_8;1jWbf4jhzGA_8-8-rgb_front;74.7;77.02;So you see I can push it over.;8;8
12809;1jWbf4jhzGA;1jWbf4jhzGA-8-rgb_front;1jWbf4jhzGA_9;1jWbf4jhzGA_9-8-rgb_front;78.31;86.54;Now I've made the clearance that we need for this side and we're going to go ahead and tighten this up right there.;8;23

12812;1jYZFgVz9YM;1jYZFgVz9YM-8-rgb_front;1jYZFgVz9YM_3;1jYZFgVz9YM_3-8-rgb_front;12.55;22.11;We've got an exercise for the front part of our delt which is called the anterior, straight out lifts and now we are going to concentrate on the middle or the medial part of our arm and build this muscle right here.;8;42
12813;1jYZFgVz9YM;1jYZFgVz9YM-8-rgb_front;1jYZFgVz9YM_4;1jYZFgVz9YM_4-8-rgb_front;22.55;34.66;What we are going to do is we are going to take our dumbbells and we are going to start from the side, nice stance, bent knees and what we are going to do is go straight up and down, straight up and down.;8;44
12814;1jYZFgVz9YM;1jYZFgVz9YM-8-rgb_front;1jYZFgVz9YM_5;1jYZFgVz9YM_5-8-rgb_front;34.66;49.47;You want to have your elbows bent a little bit and you want to take this up about ear height boom, right there, nice controlled motion up, controlled down, explosion up and down, straight up and down.;8;37
12815;1jYZFgVz9YM;1jYZFgVz9YM-8-rgb_front;1jYZFgVz9YM_6;1jYZFgVz9YM_6-8-rgb_front;49.47;61.37;You want to have your elbows bent a little bit and you want to take this up about ear height, boom, right there, nice controlled motion up, controlled down, explosion up, and down.;8;33
12816;1jYZFgVz9YM;1jYZFgVz9YM-8-rgb_front;1jYZFgVz9YM_7;1jYZFgVz9YM_7-8-rgb_front;61.85;66.65;And again this is going to work the side or medial part of your delt.;8;15
12817;1jeK8PkhsR4;1jeK8PkhsR4-8-rgb_front;1jeK8PkhsR4_0;1jeK8PkhsR4_0-8-rgb_front;0.04;8.83;The next area I want to talk about is one that I'm particular proud of myself, pretty much designed this under my own thinking.;8;24
12818;1jeK8PkhsR4;1jeK8PkhsR4-8-rgb_front;1jeK8PkhsR4_1;1jeK8PkhsR4_1-8-rgb_front;9.26;12.85;What we have here, is what I'm going to call the small head target mirrors.;8;15
12819;1jeK8PkhsR4;1jeK8PkhsR4-8-rgb_front;1jeK8PkhsR4_11;1jeK8PkhsR4_11-8-rgb_front;70.33;78.69;They don't train at Bill's gym so you can bet that their face is going to still be here, while your face is down a little bit lower and out of the head target mirror.;8;35
12820;1jeK8PkhsR4;1jeK8PkhsR4-8-rgb_front;1jeK8PkhsR4_12;1jeK8PkhsR4_12-8-rgb_front;79.46;82.35;When you step back again, it's ok to have your face in the mirror.;8;14
12821;1jeK8PkhsR4;1jeK8PkhsR4-8-rgb_front;1jeK8PkhsR4_13;1jeK8PkhsR4_13-8-rgb_front;82.66;84.36;They can't hit you, you can't hit them.;8;8
12822;1jeK8PkhsR4;1jeK8PkhsR4-8-rgb_front;1jeK8PkhsR4_14;1jeK8PkhsR4_14-8-rgb_front;84.36;86.55;You're half a step away, this is where you need to relax.;8;12
12823;1jeK8PkhsR4;1jeK8PkhsR4-8-rgb_front;1jeK8PkhsR4_15;1jeK8PkhsR4_15-8-rgb_front;86.91;89.09;So, as we step forward we're bending down.;8;8
12824;1jeK8PkhsR4;1jeK8PkhsR4-8-rgb_front;1jeK8PkhsR4_16;1jeK8PkhsR4_16-8-rgb_front;89.09;90.0;We're getting out of the mirror.;8;6
12825;1jeK8PkhsR4;1jeK8PkhsR4-8-rgb_front;1jeK8PkhsR4_17_18;1jeK8PkhsR4_17_18-8-rgb_front;90.36;97.73;Ok. And, not only is that good for just a jab. But, it is also good as you can see for the one two left right.;8;26
12826;1jeK8PkhsR4;1jeK8PkhsR4-8-rgb_front;1jeK8PkhsR4_19_20_21;1jeK8PkhsR4_19_20_21-8-rgb_front;98.05;110.33;Ok. We start throwing now one two, two rights. Again, keep your face out of the mirror. So, four different height mirrors for four different boxers.;8;26
12827;1jeK8PkhsR4;1jeK8PkhsR4-8-rgb_front;1jeK8PkhsR4_2;1jeK8PkhsR4_2-8-rgb_front;13.21;22.23;I've got four foot square mirrors adjusted a little bit different heights on the wall here.;8;16
12828;1jeK8PkhsR4;1jeK8PkhsR4-8-rgb_front;1jeK8PkhsR4_22;1jeK8PkhsR4_22-8-rgb_front;110.93;112.77;Even this one here, for the younger boxers.;8;8
12829;1jeK8PkhsR4;1jeK8PkhsR4-8-rgb_front;1jeK8PkhsR4_23;1jeK8PkhsR4_23-8-rgb_front;113.11;114.78;Actually, I had to draw a little circle in the mirror.;8;11
12830;1jeK8PkhsR4;1jeK8PkhsR4-8-rgb_front;1jeK8PkhsR4_24;1jeK8PkhsR4_24-8-rgb_front;114.78;120.98;Because, they were so small that they were covering the whole mirror.;8;12
12831;1jeK8PkhsR4;1jeK8PkhsR4-8-rgb_front;1jeK8PkhsR4_25;1jeK8PkhsR4_25-8-rgb_front;121.71;129.23;So, again it's one of the few times where being having your face directly in the mirror is not a good thing.;8;22
12832;1jeK8PkhsR4;1jeK8PkhsR4-8-rgb_front;1jeK8PkhsR4_26;1jeK8PkhsR4_26-8-rgb_front;129.8;130.19;Thanks.;8;1
12833;1jeK8PkhsR4;1jeK8PkhsR4-8-rgb_front;1jeK8PkhsR4_3;1jeK8PkhsR4_3-8-rgb_front;22.67;29.76;And, what I have my boxers do is pick one that is approximately their face is dead center of that mirror.;8;21
12834;1jeK8PkhsR4;1jeK8PkhsR4-8-rgb_front;1jeK8PkhsR4_4;1jeK8PkhsR4_4-8-rgb_front;29.8;34.84;What we do is, is I tell them if you take a step back from the mirror.;8;17
12835;1jeK8PkhsR4;1jeK8PkhsR4-8-rgb_front;1jeK8PkhsR4_5;1jeK8PkhsR4_5-8-rgb_front;36.29;42.9;As you punch yourself in the face, you can simulate that being another boxer punching you.;8;16
12836;1jeK8PkhsR4;1jeK8PkhsR4-8-rgb_front;1jeK8PkhsR4_6;1jeK8PkhsR4_6-8-rgb_front;44.27;52.93;So, as you step forward and your fist comes almost directly into your face you can expect that other boxer to be punching you.;8;24
12837;1jeK8PkhsR4;1jeK8PkhsR4-8-rgb_front;1jeK8PkhsR4_7;1jeK8PkhsR4_7-8-rgb_front;53.22;57.83;So, what we're trying to do is get your face out of the target out of the head target mirror.;8;20
12838;1jeK8PkhsR4;1jeK8PkhsR4-8-rgb_front;1jeK8PkhsR4_8;1jeK8PkhsR4_8-8-rgb_front;58.04;58.47;Ok.;8;1
12839;1jeK8PkhsR4;1jeK8PkhsR4-8-rgb_front;1jeK8PkhsR4_9_10;1jeK8PkhsR4_9_10-8-rgb_front;58.88;69.91;So, as we're stepping forward we're going to bend at the knees and get our face out of the mirror. Ok. Our first, on the other hand is still going directly into mirror directly into their face.;8;37
12840;1joPNyRKT78;1joPNyRKT78-8-rgb_front;1joPNyRKT78_0;1joPNyRKT78_0-8-rgb_front;0.4;6.02;OK, remember that when you are sitting in a stool it's a little bit different than sitting in a chair on the floor.;8;23
12841;1joPNyRKT78;1joPNyRKT78-8-rgb_front;1joPNyRKT78_1;1joPNyRKT78_1-8-rgb_front;6.45;10.26;So what I want you to do is once again think about your legs ladies.;8;15
12842;1joPNyRKT78;1joPNyRKT78-8-rgb_front;1joPNyRKT78_10;1joPNyRKT78_10-8-rgb_front;40.1;44.79;Than you do a chair on the floor because your feet are now lifted from the floor.;8;17
12843;1joPNyRKT78;1joPNyRKT78-8-rgb_front;1joPNyRKT78_11;1joPNyRKT78_11-8-rgb_front;45.08;48.79;So you're unable to keep that security with your feet on the floor.;8;13
12844;1joPNyRKT78;1joPNyRKT78-8-rgb_front;1joPNyRKT78_12;1joPNyRKT78_12-8-rgb_front;49.18;51.5;This is why you want to keep the right foot in front.;8;12
12845;1joPNyRKT78;1joPNyRKT78-8-rgb_front;1joPNyRKT78_13;1joPNyRKT78_13-8-rgb_front;51.73;56.13;The left one behind and a little bit of placement with the feet diagonal.;8;14
12846;1joPNyRKT78;1joPNyRKT78-8-rgb_front;1joPNyRKT78_14;1joPNyRKT78_14-8-rgb_front;56.25;58.13;On the right side of the chair here.;8;8
12847;1joPNyRKT78;1joPNyRKT78-8-rgb_front;1joPNyRKT78_15;1joPNyRKT78_15-8-rgb_front;58.24;60.74;While I rest my hands on the left hip.;8;9
12848;1joPNyRKT78;1joPNyRKT78-8-rgb_front;1joPNyRKT78_16;1joPNyRKT78_16-8-rgb_front;61.29;66.39;So it gives your body balance and a lot of security while sitting high up in a stool.;8;18
12849;1joPNyRKT78;1joPNyRKT78-8-rgb_front;1joPNyRKT78_17;1joPNyRKT78_17-8-rgb_front;66.42;67.78;Which is raised up off the floor.;8;7
12850;1joPNyRKT78;1joPNyRKT78-8-rgb_front;1joPNyRKT78_2;1joPNyRKT78_2-8-rgb_front;10.52;11.87;Keep the knees together.;8;4
12851;1joPNyRKT78;1joPNyRKT78-8-rgb_front;1joPNyRKT78_3;1joPNyRKT78_3-8-rgb_front;12.22;13.48;Keep the legs crossed.;8;4
12852;1joPNyRKT78;1joPNyRKT78-8-rgb_front;1joPNyRKT78_4;1joPNyRKT78_4-8-rgb_front;13.63;16.22;Ladies keep in mind I keep my right foot in front.;8;11
12853;1joPNyRKT78;1joPNyRKT78-8-rgb_front;1joPNyRKT78_5;1joPNyRKT78_5-8-rgb_front;16.66;21.54;I place my left foot behind the right and then I place it on the step of the stool.;8;19
12854;1joPNyRKT78;1joPNyRKT78-8-rgb_front;1joPNyRKT78_6;1joPNyRKT78_6-8-rgb_front;22.04;28.03;Resting the legs this feels much more comfortable than dangling or them with the knees apart.;8;16
12855;1joPNyRKT78;1joPNyRKT78-8-rgb_front;1joPNyRKT78_7;1joPNyRKT78_7-8-rgb_front;28.03;29.99;Which is very unattractive as we know.;8;7
12856;1joPNyRKT78;1joPNyRKT78-8-rgb_front;1joPNyRKT78_8;1joPNyRKT78_8-8-rgb_front;30.25;32.51;So keep your hands again to the side.;8;8
12857;1joPNyRKT78;1joPNyRKT78-8-rgb_front;1joPNyRKT78_9;1joPNyRKT78_9-8-rgb_front;32.82;39.78;Keep your posture maintain it and in a stool your going to find you're going to sit a little bit deeper into the seat of the chair.;8;27
12858;1jx2aBn_2_U;1jx2aBn_2_U-8-rgb_front;1jx2aBn_2_U_1;1jx2aBn_2_U_1-8-rgb_front;2.58;3.27;Welcome back.;8;2
12859;1jx2aBn_2_U;1jx2aBn_2_U-8-rgb_front;1jx2aBn_2_U_10;1jx2aBn_2_U_10-8-rgb_front;38.89;40.1;The little gold circles.;8;4

12861;1jx2aBn_2_U;1jx2aBn_2_U-8-rgb_front;1jx2aBn_2_U_12;1jx2aBn_2_U_12-8-rgb_front;43.88;52.14;You just go around the edges, not to confuse it with air bubbles, because you'll see like it gets white and frothy around the edges of the pot on the inside.;8;31
12862;1jx2aBn_2_U;1jx2aBn_2_U-8-rgb_front;1jx2aBn_2_U_13;1jx2aBn_2_U_13-8-rgb_front;52.38;56.44;That's just air bubbles as the water is boiling, so don't let that fool you.;8;15
12863;1jx2aBn_2_U;1jx2aBn_2_U-8-rgb_front;1jx2aBn_2_U_14;1jx2aBn_2_U_14-8-rgb_front;56.44;66.81;And you just go around and skim any off.;8;9
12864;1jx2aBn_2_U;1jx2aBn_2_U-8-rgb_front;1jx2aBn_2_U_15;1jx2aBn_2_U_15-8-rgb_front;66.81;68.33;We've done really well, actually.;8;5
12865;1jx2aBn_2_U;1jx2aBn_2_U-8-rgb_front;1jx2aBn_2_U_16;1jx2aBn_2_U_16-8-rgb_front;68.48;69.23;We're very fortunate.;8;3

12867;1jx2aBn_2_U;1jx2aBn_2_U-8-rgb_front;1jx2aBn_2_U_18;1jx2aBn_2_U_18-8-rgb_front;70.98;73.14;In the meantime, just gonna stir the noodles.;8;8
12868;1jx2aBn_2_U;1jx2aBn_2_U-8-rgb_front;1jx2aBn_2_U_19;1jx2aBn_2_U_19-8-rgb_front;73.14;76.05;I think they're just about ready to put in the colander.;8;11

12870;1jx2aBn_2_U;1jx2aBn_2_U-8-rgb_front;1jx2aBn_2_U_20;1jx2aBn_2_U_20-8-rgb_front;76.81;81.95;We'll just put the lid back on here a second.;8;10
12871;1jx2aBn_2_U;1jx2aBn_2_U-8-rgb_front;1jx2aBn_2_U_21;1jx2aBn_2_U_21-8-rgb_front;82.86;89.27;Let's bring the noodles over and pour them into the colander.;8;11
12872;1jx2aBn_2_U;1jx2aBn_2_U-8-rgb_front;1jx2aBn_2_U_22;1jx2aBn_2_U_22-8-rgb_front;95.25;100.04;That's a trick I always do when I put the noodles in the colander.;8;14
12873;1jx2aBn_2_U;1jx2aBn_2_U-8-rgb_front;1jx2aBn_2_U_23;1jx2aBn_2_U_23-8-rgb_front;100.04;101.1;You see the steam that comes up?;8;7
12874;1jx2aBn_2_U;1jx2aBn_2_U-8-rgb_front;1jx2aBn_2_U_24;1jx2aBn_2_U_24-8-rgb_front;101.13;102.35;I always pull across.;8;4

12877;1jx2aBn_2_U;1jx2aBn_2_U-8-rgb_front;1jx2aBn_2_U_27;1jx2aBn_2_U_27-8-rgb_front;112.45;115.56;Let soak in the pot, the corning ware just a second.;8;11

12879;1jx2aBn_2_U;1jx2aBn_2_U-8-rgb_front;1jx2aBn_2_U_29;1jx2aBn_2_U_29-8-rgb_front;120.28;122.1;Any more skimming to do?;8;5

12881;1jx2aBn_2_U;1jx2aBn_2_U-8-rgb_front;1jx2aBn_2_U_30;1jx2aBn_2_U_30-8-rgb_front;123.53;127.03;Let's just turn that off.;8;5
12882;1jx2aBn_2_U;1jx2aBn_2_U-8-rgb_front;1jx2aBn_2_U_31;1jx2aBn_2_U_31-8-rgb_front;127.1;130.88;O.K., one more time around the pot we should be good to go.;8;13
12883;1jx2aBn_2_U;1jx2aBn_2_U-8-rgb_front;1jx2aBn_2_U_32;1jx2aBn_2_U_32-8-rgb_front;131.09;138.48;In the meantime, the pot on the back of the stove, I'm getting the water ready to do the matza balls in there.;8;23
12884;1jx2aBn_2_U;1jx2aBn_2_U-8-rgb_front;1jx2aBn_2_U_33;1jx2aBn_2_U_33-8-rgb_front;138.7;143.23;It all takes time when you've got to kind of coordinate the time to get your pots and water boiling.;8;20

12890;1jx2aBn_2_U;1jx2aBn_2_U-8-rgb_front;1jx2aBn_2_U_9;1jx2aBn_2_U_9-8-rgb_front;35.47;38.89;I'm sure you've seen them in soup.;8;7
12891;1jzAlQtJpcA;1jzAlQtJpcA-8-rgb_front;1jzAlQtJpcA_0;1jzAlQtJpcA_0-8-rgb_front;0.49;4.23;We have all the pieces we need for our body, and also our head, rolled and taped.;8;17

13162;1lkC3y2g5do;1lkC3y2g5do-8-rgb_front;1lkC3y2g5do_3;1lkC3y2g5do_3-8-rgb_front;36.41;42.11;So what you want to do is, you want to make sure that you can ollie high enough to get onto whatever you're getting onto.;8;25
13163;1lkC3y2g5do;1lkC3y2g5do-8-rgb_front;1lkC3y2g5do_4;1lkC3y2g5do_4-8-rgb_front;42.44;45.11;And after that, it's just going to be trial and error.;8;11

13259;1mR-3aBnMFo;1mR-3aBnMFo-8-rgb_front;1mR-3aBnMFo_12;1mR-3aBnMFo_12-8-rgb_front;133.91;143.61;Or you could use it to rub on to the body for like aromatherapy treatment.;8;15

13267;1mR-3aBnMFo;1mR-3aBnMFo-8-rgb_front;1mR-3aBnMFo_6;1mR-3aBnMFo_6-8-rgb_front;87.16;95.55;So here's chamomile tea that's readily available, and here is a Japanese tea, herbal tea that you can also buy, green tea.;8;22

13290;1mWIOvyqfUI;1mWIOvyqfUI-8-rgb_front;1mWIOvyqfUI_1;1mWIOvyqfUI_1-8-rgb_front;8.26;9.71;This is a sling that I use.;8;7
13291;1mWIOvyqfUI;1mWIOvyqfUI-8-rgb_front;1mWIOvyqfUI_10;1mWIOvyqfUI_10-8-rgb_front;64.87;75.94;You just keep going around till you get to the end.;8;11
13292;1mWIOvyqfUI;1mWIOvyqfUI-8-rgb_front;1mWIOvyqfUI_11;1mWIOvyqfUI_11-8-rgb_front;76.64;91.48;Then you have this loop on here that is created from the rope that we just wrapped around and pass the loop from the rope that you were wrapping and then you can tighten it up here.;8;37
13293;1mWIOvyqfUI;1mWIOvyqfUI-8-rgb_front;1mWIOvyqfUI_12;1mWIOvyqfUI_12-8-rgb_front;94.07;100.69;This gives you a nice little hook or a loop to hook through with a Caribbean or whatnot.;8;18
13294;1mWIOvyqfUI;1mWIOvyqfUI-8-rgb_front;1mWIOvyqfUI_13;1mWIOvyqfUI_13-8-rgb_front;100.97;114.87;It is not the best to store because if you store a rope and you are going to put weight on it, it is not the best idea to have because it starts to break down the fibers.;8;38
13295;1mWIOvyqfUI;1mWIOvyqfUI-8-rgb_front;1mWIOvyqfUI_2;1mWIOvyqfUI_2-8-rgb_front;9.71;20.95;It is kind of a longer sling, but I use this for a backing up belay device such as like an ATC, or Traffic Control, or a figure eight.;8;29
13296;1mWIOvyqfUI;1mWIOvyqfUI-8-rgb_front;1mWIOvyqfUI_3;1mWIOvyqfUI_3-8-rgb_front;21.74;23.85;I will show you how to use that later.;8;9
13297;1mWIOvyqfUI;1mWIOvyqfUI-8-rgb_front;1mWIOvyqfUI_4;1mWIOvyqfUI_4-8-rgb_front;24.56;31.11;But anyway, first thing you need to know about your sling is a way to carry it around that is useful.;8;21
13298;1mWIOvyqfUI;1mWIOvyqfUI-8-rgb_front;1mWIOvyqfUI_5;1mWIOvyqfUI_5-8-rgb_front;31.62;34.19;A lot of guys will throw it over like so.;8;10
13299;1mWIOvyqfUI;1mWIOvyqfUI-8-rgb_front;1mWIOvyqfUI_6;1mWIOvyqfUI_6-8-rgb_front;34.24;38.39;This kind of bothers me just because it is just something that could get stuck.;8;15
13300;1mWIOvyqfUI;1mWIOvyqfUI-8-rgb_front;1mWIOvyqfUI_7;1mWIOvyqfUI_7-8-rgb_front;38.56;45.47;What I actually like to do is start at the bottom and kind of fold it in half.;8;18
13301;1mWIOvyqfUI;1mWIOvyqfUI-8-rgb_front;1mWIOvyqfUI_8;1mWIOvyqfUI_8-8-rgb_front;45.5;53.46;I am going to leave enough room because we are going to wrap the other end around this.;8;18
13302;1mWIOvyqfUI;1mWIOvyqfUI-8-rgb_front;1mWIOvyqfUI_9;1mWIOvyqfUI_9-8-rgb_front;54.44;64.52;And you just start wrapping like so.;8;7
13303;1m_A7gr1174;1m_A7gr1174-8-rgb_front;1m_A7gr1174_0;1m_A7gr1174_0-8-rgb_front;0.3;2.77;In this clip I want to talk to you about freestyle motocross.;8;12
13304;1m_A7gr1174;1m_A7gr1174-8-rgb_front;1m_A7gr1174_1;1m_A7gr1174_1-8-rgb_front;3.06;6.7;Freestyle motocross really kind of putting itself on the map.;8;10
13305;1m_A7gr1174;1m_A7gr1174-8-rgb_front;1m_A7gr1174_10;1m_A7gr1174_10-8-rgb_front;46.35;55.14;Now you've got guys like Travis Pastrana doing double backflips and variations into their flips and a lot of really cool stuff coming from motocross.;8;25
13306;1m_A7gr1174;1m_A7gr1174-8-rgb_front;1m_A7gr1174_11;1m_A7gr1174_11-8-rgb_front;55.14;58.66;There's kind of a different way to set up your bike for freestyling.;8;13
13307;1m_A7gr1174;1m_A7gr1174-8-rgb_front;1m_A7gr1174_12;1m_A7gr1174_12-8-rgb_front;58.93;63.96;This bike, or my bike, is primarily motocross, but a lot of guys they cut down their seats.;8;18
13308;1m_A7gr1174;1m_A7gr1174-8-rgb_front;1m_A7gr1174_13;1m_A7gr1174_13-8-rgb_front;64.2;68.74;You know make their seat foams really thin because they're not, you know they're not needing to do the moto.;8;20
13309;1m_A7gr1174;1m_A7gr1174-8-rgb_front;1m_A7gr1174_14;1m_A7gr1174_14-8-rgb_front;68.74;83.73;They're not needing that cush in that seat to go faster on those corners and they've got a lot of big, say hand holds back here and their suspension might tend to be really stiff because you know they're on average jumping about 100 foot plus jumps.;8;47
13310;1m_A7gr1174;1m_A7gr1174-8-rgb_front;1m_A7gr1174_15;1m_A7gr1174_15-8-rgb_front;84.03;89.49;So you're really going to want to, you know, absorb those landings and their bikes are completely set up for that.;8;21
13311;1m_A7gr1174;1m_A7gr1174-8-rgb_front;1m_A7gr1174_16;1m_A7gr1174_16-8-rgb_front;89.76;91.15;Maybe a little taller bars.;8;5
13312;1m_A7gr1174;1m_A7gr1174-8-rgb_front;1m_A7gr1174_17;1m_A7gr1174_17-8-rgb_front;91.43;96.76;No cross pads because they're doing a lot of in and out or putting their feet up here all the time.;8;21
13313;1m_A7gr1174;1m_A7gr1174-8-rgb_front;1m_A7gr1174_18;1m_A7gr1174_18-8-rgb_front;97.0;99.11;You don't want to be getting hung up on anything like that.;8;12
13314;1m_A7gr1174;1m_A7gr1174-8-rgb_front;1m_A7gr1174_19;1m_A7gr1174_19-8-rgb_front;99.77;102.17;And a lot of events are really getting pretty big.;8;10
13315;1m_A7gr1174;1m_A7gr1174-8-rgb_front;1m_A7gr1174_2;1m_A7gr1174_2-8-rgb_front;7.04;13.75;You know it used to be just kind of be a lot of free riding out in the hills, maybe out in California, Beaumont, Artille Wells, a lot of places like that.;8;32
13316;1m_A7gr1174;1m_A7gr1174-8-rgb_front;1m_A7gr1174_20;1m_A7gr1174_20-8-rgb_front;102.17;105.5;So that's also a cool thing is a lot of media coverage from this sport.;8;15
13317;1m_A7gr1174;1m_A7gr1174-8-rgb_front;1m_A7gr1174_21;1m_A7gr1174_21-8-rgb_front;105.61;112.16;So take a look online, you know, there's a lot of freestyle events, national and more local that are probably going to be near you.;8;25
13318;1m_A7gr1174;1m_A7gr1174-8-rgb_front;1m_A7gr1174_22;1m_A7gr1174_22-8-rgb_front;112.16;114.09;Come check it out and that stuff.;8;7
13319;1m_A7gr1174;1m_A7gr1174-8-rgb_front;1m_A7gr1174_23;1m_A7gr1174_23-8-rgb_front;114.48;119.09;I can't personally do a lot of the tricks that they can do on there but it's real exciting to see in person.;8;23
13320;1m_A7gr1174;1m_A7gr1174-8-rgb_front;1m_A7gr1174_3;1m_A7gr1174_3-8-rgb_front;14.0;15.29;Guys just hitting dirt jumps.;8;5
13321;1m_A7gr1174;1m_A7gr1174-8-rgb_front;1m_A7gr1174_4;1m_A7gr1174_4-8-rgb_front;15.56;21.8;Now these days it's come into the stadiums, into the X-Games, the Gravity Games, the Mountain Dew Tour.;8;18
13322;1m_A7gr1174;1m_A7gr1174-8-rgb_front;1m_A7gr1174_5;1m_A7gr1174_5-8-rgb_front;22.69;23.86;It's the entire series.;8;4
13323;1m_A7gr1174;1m_A7gr1174-8-rgb_front;1m_A7gr1174_6;1m_A7gr1174_6-8-rgb_front;23.86;28.35;So as well as the motocross and the supercross series they also have freestyle actual series.;8;16
13324;1m_A7gr1174;1m_A7gr1174-8-rgb_front;1m_A7gr1174_7;1m_A7gr1174_7-8-rgb_front;28.35;29.87;You can catch them on TV all the time.;8;9
13325;1m_A7gr1174;1m_A7gr1174-8-rgb_front;1m_A7gr1174_8;1m_A7gr1174_8-8-rgb_front;30.43;37.02;I'd say Nate Adams, Travis Pastrana and Kenny Bartram, these guys, you know, they've all just been instrumental in the motocross scene.;8;22
13326;1m_A7gr1174;1m_A7gr1174-8-rgb_front;1m_A7gr1174_9;1m_A7gr1174_9-8-rgb_front;37.53;46.03;Back in 1999 when Carey Hart flew his first backflip in New York at the Gravity Games, that was just a huge moment for motocross.;8;25
13327;1mcmnmxg64U;1mcmnmxg64U-8-rgb_front;1mcmnmxg64U_0;1mcmnmxg64U_0-8-rgb_front;0.07;2.47;So, you're at the restaurant and you want to impress your lady.;8;12
13328;1mcmnmxg64U;1mcmnmxg64U-8-rgb_front;1mcmnmxg64U_1;1mcmnmxg64U_1-8-rgb_front;2.92;6.63;So, I'm Robert Segundo and I'm going to teach you how to make a paper rose.;8;16
13329;1mcmnmxg64U;1mcmnmxg64U-8-rgb_front;1mcmnmxg64U_10;1mcmnmxg64U_10-8-rgb_front;27.85;34.61;Basically, we're just going to take this and roll this up like so.;8;13
13330;1mcmnmxg64U;1mcmnmxg64U-8-rgb_front;1mcmnmxg64U_11;1mcmnmxg64U_11-8-rgb_front;35.47;38.76;Kind of keep this open end here we'll see with your fingers.;8;12
13331;1mcmnmxg64U;1mcmnmxg64U-8-rgb_front;1mcmnmxg64U_12;1mcmnmxg64U_12-8-rgb_front;39.2;40.83;Just going to come down here below it.;8;8
13332;1mcmnmxg64U;1mcmnmxg64U-8-rgb_front;1mcmnmxg64U_13;1mcmnmxg64U_13-8-rgb_front;41.38;43.46;Just going to twist it up just a little bit.;8;10
13333;1mcmnmxg64U;1mcmnmxg64U-8-rgb_front;1mcmnmxg64U_14;1mcmnmxg64U_14-8-rgb_front;44.26;54.29;Now, this flap here we're going to kind of hold it out as well while we twist the rest of it up.;8;22
13334;1mcmnmxg64U;1mcmnmxg64U-8-rgb_front;1mcmnmxg64U_15;1mcmnmxg64U_15-8-rgb_front;54.29;63.93;This is great when you're out and you bought your lady that happy meal and you really want to impress her with a little flower afterwards.;8;26
13335;1mcmnmxg64U;1mcmnmxg64U-8-rgb_front;1mcmnmxg64U_16;1mcmnmxg64U_16-8-rgb_front;64.75;66.33;So, just kind of twist it up real good.;8;9
13336;1mcmnmxg64U;1mcmnmxg64U-8-rgb_front;1mcmnmxg64U_17;1mcmnmxg64U_17-8-rgb_front;67.05;72.32;Make sure to keep your top real good and you can kind of open this up and shape it out.;8;20
13337;1mcmnmxg64U;1mcmnmxg64U-8-rgb_front;1mcmnmxg64U_18;1mcmnmxg64U_18-8-rgb_front;73.25;75.85;We need to twist it just a little bit tighter here.;8;11
13338;1mcmnmxg64U;1mcmnmxg64U-8-rgb_front;1mcmnmxg64U_19;1mcmnmxg64U_19-8-rgb_front;75.85;76.86;Al least, I need to.;8;5
13339;1mcmnmxg64U;1mcmnmxg64U-8-rgb_front;1mcmnmxg64U_2;1mcmnmxg64U_2-8-rgb_front;7.15;11.0;If we look down here, we can see I've just a regular napkin.;8;13
13340;1mcmnmxg64U;1mcmnmxg64U-8-rgb_front;1mcmnmxg64U_20;1mcmnmxg64U_20-8-rgb_front;81.33;82.57;Make sure it's real good and tight.;8;7
13341;1mcmnmxg64U;1mcmnmxg64U-8-rgb_front;1mcmnmxg64U_21;1mcmnmxg64U_21-8-rgb_front;82.6;87.78;There you go.;8;3
13342;1mcmnmxg64U;1mcmnmxg64U-8-rgb_front;1mcmnmxg64U_22;1mcmnmxg64U_22-8-rgb_front;87.78;88.28;Alright.;8;1
13343;1mcmnmxg64U;1mcmnmxg64U-8-rgb_front;1mcmnmxg64U_23;1mcmnmxg64U_23-8-rgb_front;88.6;89.23;And, there it is.;8;4
13344;1mcmnmxg64U;1mcmnmxg64U-8-rgb_front;1mcmnmxg64U_24;1mcmnmxg64U_24-8-rgb_front;89.23;91.88;There's your paper flower, sure to impress.;8;7
13345;1mcmnmxg64U;1mcmnmxg64U-8-rgb_front;1mcmnmxg64U_25;1mcmnmxg64U_25-8-rgb_front;92.46;94.37;And, she's going to be very happy and willing tonight.;8;10
13346;1mcmnmxg64U;1mcmnmxg64U-8-rgb_front;1mcmnmxg64U_26;1mcmnmxg64U_26-8-rgb_front;95.01;97.58;My name is Robert Segundo and this is your paper flower.;8;11
13347;1mcmnmxg64U;1mcmnmxg64U-8-rgb_front;1mcmnmxg64U_3;1mcmnmxg64U_3-8-rgb_front;11.0;12.1;What I'm going to do, is I'm going to take it.;8;11
13348;1mcmnmxg64U;1mcmnmxg64U-8-rgb_front;1mcmnmxg64U_4;1mcmnmxg64U_4-8-rgb_front;12.13;14.05;I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to unfold it.;8;11
13349;1mcmnmxg64U;1mcmnmxg64U-8-rgb_front;1mcmnmxg64U_5;1mcmnmxg64U_5-8-rgb_front;14.59;15.39;Open it all the way.;8;5
13350;1mcmnmxg64U;1mcmnmxg64U-8-rgb_front;1mcmnmxg64U_6;1mcmnmxg64U_6-8-rgb_front;15.39;17.6;Now, this one is kind of an odd shape.;8;9
13351;1mcmnmxg64U;1mcmnmxg64U-8-rgb_front;1mcmnmxg64U_7;1mcmnmxg64U_7-8-rgb_front;17.6;21.24;So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to kind of fold down a little bit here at the top.;8;21
13352;1mcmnmxg64U;1mcmnmxg64U-8-rgb_front;1mcmnmxg64U_8;1mcmnmxg64U_8-8-rgb_front;21.24;22.75;This is going to be for the petals at the top.;8;11
13353;1mcmnmxg64U;1mcmnmxg64U-8-rgb_front;1mcmnmxg64U_9;1mcmnmxg64U_9-8-rgb_front;22.75;26.92;And, what I like to do is fold it back up like so.;8;13
13354;1mdMz4RkRdA;1mdMz4RkRdA-8-rgb_front;1mdMz4RkRdA_0;1mdMz4RkRdA_0-8-rgb_front;0.2;1.68;I totally feel this mask tingling.;8;6
13355;1mdMz4RkRdA;1mdMz4RkRdA-8-rgb_front;1mdMz4RkRdA_1;1mdMz4RkRdA_1-8-rgb_front;1.68;5.08;It smells good, it feels good, this is a winner.;8;10
13356;1mdMz4RkRdA;1mdMz4RkRdA-8-rgb_front;1mdMz4RkRdA_10;1mdMz4RkRdA_10-8-rgb_front;35.57;38.53;This is when I actually do use a wash cloth to take off.;8;13
13357;1mdMz4RkRdA;1mdMz4RkRdA-8-rgb_front;1mdMz4RkRdA_11;1mdMz4RkRdA_11-8-rgb_front;40.62;41.11;Immerse it.;8;2
13358;1mdMz4RkRdA;1mdMz4RkRdA-8-rgb_front;1mdMz4RkRdA_12;1mdMz4RkRdA_12-8-rgb_front;41.62;49.64;And, again, you can use either cold water, some people like to use cold water in the morning because it gives them kind of a pick me up.;8;28
13359;1mdMz4RkRdA;1mdMz4RkRdA-8-rgb_front;1mdMz4RkRdA_13;1mdMz4RkRdA_13-8-rgb_front;50.45;54.07;I like to do my mask in the evening time so I like warm water.;8;15
13360;1mdMz4RkRdA;1mdMz4RkRdA-8-rgb_front;1mdMz4RkRdA_14;1mdMz4RkRdA_14-8-rgb_front;54.87;58.58;Never hot water, but warm water because it kind of gives me that comforting feel.;8;15
13361;1mdMz4RkRdA;1mdMz4RkRdA-8-rgb_front;1mdMz4RkRdA_15;1mdMz4RkRdA_15-8-rgb_front;58.62;60.04;But, it's up to you to what you like.;8;9
13362;1mdMz4RkRdA;1mdMz4RkRdA-8-rgb_front;1mdMz4RkRdA_16;1mdMz4RkRdA_16-8-rgb_front;60.98;67.0;Take your wash cloth, gently remove, circular motions.;8;8
13363;1mdMz4RkRdA;1mdMz4RkRdA-8-rgb_front;1mdMz4RkRdA_17;1mdMz4RkRdA_17-8-rgb_front;67.73;77.44;Circular motions, remember gentle because the wash cloth itself is a natural exfoliant for skin so it's going to help also with the mask.;8;24
13364;1mdMz4RkRdA;1mdMz4RkRdA-8-rgb_front;1mdMz4RkRdA_18;1mdMz4RkRdA_18-8-rgb_front;81.94;85.8;Gentle, circular sweeping motions to take the mask off.;8;9
13365;1mdMz4RkRdA;1mdMz4RkRdA-8-rgb_front;1mdMz4RkRdA_19;1mdMz4RkRdA_19-8-rgb_front;90.74;91.22;Wow!;8;1
13366;1mdMz4RkRdA;1mdMz4RkRdA-8-rgb_front;1mdMz4RkRdA_2;1mdMz4RkRdA_2-8-rgb_front;5.5;9.41;I really believe J Lo knows exactly what she's talking about.;8;11

13368;1mdMz4RkRdA;1mdMz4RkRdA-8-rgb_front;1mdMz4RkRdA_21;1mdMz4RkRdA_21-8-rgb_front;95.55;95.99;Okay.;8;1
13369;1mdMz4RkRdA;1mdMz4RkRdA-8-rgb_front;1mdMz4RkRdA_22;1mdMz4RkRdA_22-8-rgb_front;96.08;101.33;I might have to send J Lo an extra baby gift because she has totally turned me on to the right things.;8;22
13370;1mdMz4RkRdA;1mdMz4RkRdA-8-rgb_front;1mdMz4RkRdA_23;1mdMz4RkRdA_23-8-rgb_front;101.53;104.1;Okay, so the twins are going to get something extra for this.;8;12
13371;1mdMz4RkRdA;1mdMz4RkRdA-8-rgb_front;1mdMz4RkRdA_24;1mdMz4RkRdA_24-8-rgb_front;104.1;104.64;This is good.;8;3
13372;1mdMz4RkRdA;1mdMz4RkRdA-8-rgb_front;1mdMz4RkRdA_25;1mdMz4RkRdA_25-8-rgb_front;105.85;106.32;Oh, my.;8;2

13724;1pDmmsYwDJA;1pDmmsYwDJA-8-rgb_front;1pDmmsYwDJA_3;1pDmmsYwDJA_3-8-rgb_front;23.19;30.94;You want to take your shoulders and bring them up towards your ears, you're going to hold two or three seconds, then you're going to relax.;8;26
13725;1pDmmsYwDJA;1pDmmsYwDJA-8-rgb_front;1pDmmsYwDJA_4;1pDmmsYwDJA_4-8-rgb_front;32.74;40.3;So basically you're tensing up your shoulders and then you're releasing, all the stress coming out of your shoulders.;8;19
13726;1pDmmsYwDJA;1pDmmsYwDJA-8-rgb_front;1pDmmsYwDJA_5;1pDmmsYwDJA_5-8-rgb_front;41.38;49.43;I would suggest doing this eight to ten times holding for two to three seconds, and if you feel like you want to do some more you can do another set or two.;8;33
13727;1pDmmsYwDJA;1pDmmsYwDJA-8-rgb_front;1pDmmsYwDJA_6;1pDmmsYwDJA_6-8-rgb_front;54.06;62.37;Another exercise you can do to keep your tush from getting numb is to tense your gluteal muscles, hold for ten seconds and then release.;8;25
13728;1pDmmsYwDJA;1pDmmsYwDJA-8-rgb_front;1pDmmsYwDJA_7;1pDmmsYwDJA_7-8-rgb_front;62.37;70.61;So you're going to tense, release, tense, and release.;8;9
13729;1pDmmsYwDJA;1pDmmsYwDJA-8-rgb_front;1pDmmsYwDJA_8;1pDmmsYwDJA_8-8-rgb_front;71.19;74.36;Another exercise you can do is to help strengthen the inner thighs.;8;12
13730;1pDmmsYwDJA;1pDmmsYwDJA-8-rgb_front;1pDmmsYwDJA_9;1pDmmsYwDJA_9-8-rgb_front;74.94;87.11;You can either take a small pillow, a towel, or a sweatshirt, whatever you have in your vehicle, put in between your thighs and you can squeeze your inner thighs and then relax.;8;33
13740;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_0;1pPAkrfqnHg_0-8-rgb_front;0.44;1.42;Now we're ready to cut.;8;5
13741;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_1;1pPAkrfqnHg_1-8-rgb_front;2.47;5.15;Before we cut let me explain what I'm using here.;8;10
13742;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_10;1pPAkrfqnHg_10-8-rgb_front;51.44;59.75;So again it's just basic it's no need to be afraid of the tool just to be aware of what's going on and stay focused on what you're doing.;8;29
13743;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_11;1pPAkrfqnHg_11-8-rgb_front;60.23;73.54;A lot of people at home may not have this tool and that's fine there's other hand saws and circular saws or whatever that you could by for cheaper, but because I'm working in my shop I'm going to use the quick and easy chop saw.;8;46
13744;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_12;1pPAkrfqnHg_12-8-rgb_front;74.71;80.98;So what I've done is for one of my dimensions created a line so it's nice to know where you're going.;8;21
13745;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_13;1pPAkrfqnHg_13-8-rgb_front;81.47;92.55;One of the things to remember when cutting with the line is there's a situation that occurs when you're cutting wood and I'll demonstrate it.;8;25
13746;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_14;1pPAkrfqnHg_14-8-rgb_front;92.95;103.38;If you notice there the saw blade, the thickness of the saw blade is cut into the wood.;8;18
13747;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_15;1pPAkrfqnHg_15-8-rgb_front;104.5;114.44;We call it a curf, it's not important what you call it really, but the thing of it is we have to remember that this dimension is being lost, this amount of wood is being lost in our cut.;8;39
13748;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_16;1pPAkrfqnHg_16-8-rgb_front;114.96;126.33;So if we want like in our apron piece 16 1/8 inches to that line that means we have to make sure the blade is on the opposite of what we started our measurement.;8;34
13749;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_17;1pPAkrfqnHg_17-8-rgb_front;127.6;129.04;That's kind of an important thing.;8;6
13750;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_18;1pPAkrfqnHg_18-8-rgb_front;129.43;137.68;A lot of people don't realize that until, it could be common sense I don't know, but that's kind of an important part of the process.;8;26
13751;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_19;1pPAkrfqnHg_19-8-rgb_front;137.84;143.65;So we want to make sure that we cut on the opposite along the line but on the opposite side, clear as mud.;8;23
13752;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_2;1pPAkrfqnHg_2-8-rgb_front;5.18;11.92;I'm using a chop saw, it's called the chop saw because it cuts in a chopping fashion.;8;17
13753;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_20;1pPAkrfqnHg_20-8-rgb_front;144.74;150.43;Now once you line it up I like to bring the blade down with my hand off the trigger, which is in the handle here.;8;25
13754;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_21;1pPAkrfqnHg_21-8-rgb_front;150.68;154.63;Line my piece up and like I said just on the other side of the line.;8;16
13755;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_22;1pPAkrfqnHg_22-8-rgb_front;155.0;157.32;Once I'm lined up I hold it in my place.;8;10
13756;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_23;1pPAkrfqnHg_23-8-rgb_front;158.15;162.57;Hold it in place, my hand safe distance from the blade.;8;11
13757;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_24;1pPAkrfqnHg_24-8-rgb_front;171.59;172.49;Easy as pie!;8;3
13758;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_25;1pPAkrfqnHg_25-8-rgb_front;173.39;175.43;Now, we'll do that to the other four pieces.;8;9
13759;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_26;1pPAkrfqnHg_26-8-rgb_front;175.88;184.78;We also want to make sure that we cut our table leg down and just for repetitions so you guys remember it, we're going to do the same process again.;8;30
13760;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_27;1pPAkrfqnHg_27-8-rgb_front;186.97;195.69;Right on the line, hold it place, bring it down.;8;10
13761;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_28;1pPAkrfqnHg_28-8-rgb_front;197.38;198.31;Easy as pie!;8;3
13762;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_29;1pPAkrfqnHg_29-8-rgb_front;198.39;200.87;Once our pieces are cut we're ready to assemble.;8;9
13763;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_3;1pPAkrfqnHg_3-8-rgb_front;12.13;14.04;The trigger is up in the handle.;8;7
13764;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_4;1pPAkrfqnHg_4-8-rgb_front;15.45;23.77;The nice thing about this saw is that the guard keeps the blade covered at all times.;8;17
13765;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_5;1pPAkrfqnHg_5-8-rgb_front;24.29;30.38;You also want to make sure definitely you're wearing your eye protection during this process.;8;15
13766;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_6;1pPAkrfqnHg_6-8-rgb_front;32.0;39.42;You also want to make sure that when you're using it you line your piece up keeping it tight against the fence and holding it with one hand.;8;28
13767;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_7;1pPAkrfqnHg_7-8-rgb_front;39.8;42.95;Now where you hold it and how you hold it you have to be very careful of as well.;8;19
13768;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_8;1pPAkrfqnHg_8-8-rgb_front;42.95;45.4;Just watch where your fingers are, you don't want to take anything off.;8;13
13769;1pPAkrfqnHg;1pPAkrfqnHg-8-rgb_front;1pPAkrfqnHg_9;1pPAkrfqnHg_9-8-rgb_front;46.58;51.02;Make sure your hand is away from the blade as you bring it down.;8;14
13770;1pS3OghYuaA;1pS3OghYuaA-8-rgb_front;1pS3OghYuaA_0;1pS3OghYuaA_0-8-rgb_front;0.74;6.52;Now that you've selected your tea cup I'm going to show you how to prep it so we're able to make a nice little design in here.;8;27
13771;1pS3OghYuaA;1pS3OghYuaA-8-rgb_front;1pS3OghYuaA_1;1pS3OghYuaA_1-8-rgb_front;7.04;12.09;First of all we're going to remove the cup and this is called cling.;8;14
13772;1pS3OghYuaA;1pS3OghYuaA-8-rgb_front;1pS3OghYuaA_10;1pS3OghYuaA_10-8-rgb_front;85.88;94.86;Next you tape the container you just use your clear florist tape and just make a little X on the container.;8;21
13773;1pS3OghYuaA;1pS3OghYuaA-8-rgb_front;1pS3OghYuaA_11_12;1pS3OghYuaA_11_12-8-rgb_front;98.72;101.99;O.K. and that's how you prep the container.;8;8
13774;1pS3OghYuaA;1pS3OghYuaA-8-rgb_front;1pS3OghYuaA_2;1pS3OghYuaA_2-8-rgb_front;12.09;18.72;It's a very, very sticky tape and what this will do is secure your tea cup to the plate.;8;19
13775;1pS3OghYuaA;1pS3OghYuaA-8-rgb_front;1pS3OghYuaA_3;1pS3OghYuaA_3-8-rgb_front;19.05;35.11;You just rip off a little piece and you can pull it out and just kind of go around the little the circle on the plate and then you take your tea cup and stick it to the plate.;8;39
13776;1pS3OghYuaA;1pS3OghYuaA-8-rgb_front;1pS3OghYuaA_4;1pS3OghYuaA_4-8-rgb_front;35.94;40.02;And you don't want any of it to show so, there we go.;8;13
13777;1pS3OghYuaA;1pS3OghYuaA-8-rgb_front;1pS3OghYuaA_5;1pS3OghYuaA_5-8-rgb_front;40.91;43.61;So that's how your get this to stick.;8;8
13778;1pS3OghYuaA;1pS3OghYuaA-8-rgb_front;1pS3OghYuaA_6;1pS3OghYuaA_6-8-rgb_front;44.0;57.21;Next we're going to take a piece of floral foam, now the floral foam I have had soaking, it's best to let this soak overnight because you don't want it to have pockets of air in here.;8;37
13779;1pS3OghYuaA;1pS3OghYuaA-8-rgb_front;1pS3OghYuaA_7;1pS3OghYuaA_7-8-rgb_front;57.21;61.75;So if it soaks overnight it's going to be very moist you want it to be saturated fully.;8;18
13780;1pS3OghYuaA;1pS3OghYuaA-8-rgb_front;1pS3OghYuaA_8;1pS3OghYuaA_8-8-rgb_front;62.15;65.74;And what I'm going to do is cut a piece to fit in this container.;8;15
13781;1pS3OghYuaA;1pS3OghYuaA-8-rgb_front;1pS3OghYuaA_9;1pS3OghYuaA_9-8-rgb_front;66.05;84.91;So I'm just going to cut a little piece and we're going to just cut it down a little bit more, and a little bit more, just going to kind of wing it here, then you push it in to the container.;8;42

13797;1pnIcdqFroA;1pnIcdqFroA-8-rgb_front;1pnIcdqFroA_2;1pnIcdqFroA_2-8-rgb_front;8.61;17.0;If you focus on the air speed, the green arc is the maneuvering speed of the airplane.;8;17

13799;1pnIcdqFroA;1pnIcdqFroA-8-rgb_front;1pnIcdqFroA_4;1pnIcdqFroA_4-8-rgb_front;22.4;28.69;That's the point where complete deflection of the controls at high speed could damage the airplane.;8;16

13802;1pnIcdqFroA;1pnIcdqFroA-8-rgb_front;1pnIcdqFroA_7;1pnIcdqFroA_7-8-rgb_front;41.53;50.73;That's the point where if you exceed the red line, in this case, 100 miles an hour, then the wings may come off the airplane, which is not a good situation.;8;31
13803;1pnIcdqFroA;1pnIcdqFroA-8-rgb_front;1pnIcdqFroA_8;1pnIcdqFroA_8-8-rgb_front;50.73;54.95;"We never fly above red line; not in the airplane.";8;10

13805;1ptbP5xTIdw;1ptbP5xTIdw-8-rgb_front;1ptbP5xTIdw_1;1ptbP5xTIdw_1-8-rgb_front;4.75;8.34;So what we're going to do is simply put both hands on our knees.;8;14
13806;1ptbP5xTIdw;1ptbP5xTIdw-8-rgb_front;1ptbP5xTIdw_10;1ptbP5xTIdw_10-8-rgb_front;47.4;51.12;Five in one direction, five in the other and repeat that.;8;11

13808;1ptbP5xTIdw;1ptbP5xTIdw-8-rgb_front;1ptbP5xTIdw_12;1ptbP5xTIdw_12-8-rgb_front;59.56;60.81;So get that checked.;8;4
13809;1ptbP5xTIdw;1ptbP5xTIdw-8-rgb_front;1ptbP5xTIdw_13;1ptbP5xTIdw_13-8-rgb_front;61.33;63.68;Rotate those knees, get them warmed up, and you're ready to go.;8;12
13810;1ptbP5xTIdw;1ptbP5xTIdw-8-rgb_front;1ptbP5xTIdw_2;1ptbP5xTIdw_2-8-rgb_front;9.65;11.59;We're going to rotate our knees in one direction.;8;9

13812;1ptbP5xTIdw;1ptbP5xTIdw-8-rgb_front;1ptbP5xTIdw_4;1ptbP5xTIdw_4-8-rgb_front;15.22;23.85;Now as I rotate, I'm bending my knees bringing them forward as much as I can all the way to one side, bringing them back again.;8;26
13813;1ptbP5xTIdw;1ptbP5xTIdw-8-rgb_front;1ptbP5xTIdw_5;1ptbP5xTIdw_5-8-rgb_front;23.85;27.34;So now my knees are straight and now I bend again as I come to the other side.;8;18

13817;1ptbP5xTIdw;1ptbP5xTIdw-8-rgb_front;1ptbP5xTIdw_9;1ptbP5xTIdw_9-8-rgb_front;40.56;46.19;So, from here again, hands on the knees nice and easy, rotate one way, all the way around.;8;18

14149;1s3UAxaRWbI;1s3UAxaRWbI-8-rgb_front;1s3UAxaRWbI_4;1s3UAxaRWbI_4-8-rgb_front;29.63;38.53;If you're going to shoot the ball you might as well be shooting the ball constantly on the move, in a certain time frame, in order to get a good conditioning workout.;8;32

14191;1s5gc78drOE;1s5gc78drOE-8-rgb_front;1s5gc78drOE_16;1s5gc78drOE_16-8-rgb_front;72.33;72.53;Okay.;8;1
14192;1s5gc78drOE;1s5gc78drOE-8-rgb_front;1s5gc78drOE_17;1s5gc78drOE_17-8-rgb_front;72.53;73.24;So once again.;8;3
14193;1s5gc78drOE;1s5gc78drOE-8-rgb_front;1s5gc78drOE_18;1s5gc78drOE_18-8-rgb_front;74.17;75.87;So step, jump, kick.;8;4
14194;1s5gc78drOE;1s5gc78drOE-8-rgb_front;1s5gc78drOE_19;1s5gc78drOE_19-8-rgb_front;79.18;81.94;That's the proper way to perform the Jump Outside Crescent Kick.;8;11
14195;1s5gc78drOE;1s5gc78drOE-8-rgb_front;1s5gc78drOE_2;1s5gc78drOE_2-8-rgb_front;7.76;12.03;Okay, in this kick, there's a variety of steps that have a circular action.;8;14
14196;1s5gc78drOE;1s5gc78drOE-8-rgb_front;1s5gc78drOE_3;1s5gc78drOE_3-8-rgb_front;12.42;18.77;Okay, so starting from a standing position, okay, your first step, you're going to go slightly outward towards the corner.;8;20
14197;1s5gc78drOE;1s5gc78drOE-8-rgb_front;1s5gc78drOE_4;1s5gc78drOE_4-8-rgb_front;18.81;24.03;"So you're going to step here, so one, then step as if you're turning; two, with your toes outward.";8;19
14198;1s5gc78drOE;1s5gc78drOE-8-rgb_front;1s5gc78drOE_5;1s5gc78drOE_5-8-rgb_front;24.37;25.78;This is where you're going to be jumping.;8;8
14199;1s5gc78drOE;1s5gc78drOE-8-rgb_front;1s5gc78drOE_6;1s5gc78drOE_6-8-rgb_front;26.45;31.68;So your knee comes up as you spin around, both hands go out, Outside Crescent Kick.;8;16
14200;1s5gc78drOE;1s5gc78drOE-8-rgb_front;1s5gc78drOE_7;1s5gc78drOE_7-8-rgb_front;32.84;33.17;Okay.;8;1
14201;1s5gc78drOE;1s5gc78drOE-8-rgb_front;1s5gc78drOE_8;1s5gc78drOE_8-8-rgb_front;33.64;35.96;So performed at full speed, it looks like this.;8;9
14202;1s5gc78drOE;1s5gc78drOE-8-rgb_front;1s5gc78drOE_9;1s5gc78drOE_9-8-rgb_front;35.96;39.23;So he runs, step, jump and kick.;8;7
14203;1s7e4sHQiAs;1s7e4sHQiAs-8-rgb_front;1s7e4sHQiAs_1;1s7e4sHQiAs_1-8-rgb_front;4.66;8.18;In this video clip I would be setting up the sole.;8;11

14205;1s7e4sHQiAs;1s7e4sHQiAs-8-rgb_front;1s7e4sHQiAs_11;1s7e4sHQiAs_11-8-rgb_front;76.09;85.01;To fix it you are going to continue working the plane on the sand paper until all the red areas are completely gone.;8;23
14206;1s7e4sHQiAs;1s7e4sHQiAs-8-rgb_front;1s7e4sHQiAs_12;1s7e4sHQiAs_12-8-rgb_front;85.95;101.5;Once all the red is gone you are going to move on to a 220 grit sand paper and even a finer grit sand paper and you are going to continue this until you get a nice smooth finish on the sole of your plane.;8;45
14207;1s7e4sHQiAs;1s7e4sHQiAs-8-rgb_front;1s7e4sHQiAs_2;1s7e4sHQiAs_2-8-rgb_front;8.7;12.24;The sole is the very base of our plane.;8;9

14209;1s7e4sHQiAs;1s7e4sHQiAs-8-rgb_front;1s7e4sHQiAs_4;1s7e4sHQiAs_4-8-rgb_front;18.85;24.92;First, thing we need to do is retract the blade using the depth adjustment lever.;8;15
14210;1s7e4sHQiAs;1s7e4sHQiAs-8-rgb_front;1s7e4sHQiAs_5;1s7e4sHQiAs_5-8-rgb_front;25.98;30.83;Next we are going to take a permanent marker and color the bottom.;8;13
14211;1s7e4sHQiAs;1s7e4sHQiAs-8-rgb_front;1s7e4sHQiAs_6;1s7e4sHQiAs_6-8-rgb_front;33.24;36.43;I like to use red cause it shows up a little bit better.;8;13
14212;1s7e4sHQiAs;1s7e4sHQiAs-8-rgb_front;1s7e4sHQiAs_7;1s7e4sHQiAs_7-8-rgb_front;44.01;55.87;Next we are going to take 180 grit piece of sand paper and we are going to rub the plane on the sand paper for about 30 seconds.;8;28
14213;1s7e4sHQiAs;1s7e4sHQiAs-8-rgb_front;1s7e4sHQiAs_8;1s7e4sHQiAs_8-8-rgb_front;55.9;61.48;Now when you do this you want to make sure that your sand paper is on a true surface.;8;19
14214;1s7e4sHQiAs;1s7e4sHQiAs-8-rgb_front;1s7e4sHQiAs_9;1s7e4sHQiAs_9-8-rgb_front;61.48;64.2;I'm using a table saw in this case.;8;8

14216;1sFvWxhzyJg;1sFvWxhzyJg-8-rgb_front;1sFvWxhzyJg_2;1sFvWxhzyJg_2-8-rgb_front;16.28;25.8;First thing first, so you enter your sink, turn your faucet on.;8;12
14217;1sFvWxhzyJg;1sFvWxhzyJg-8-rgb_front;1sFvWxhzyJg_3;1sFvWxhzyJg_3-8-rgb_front;25.86;29.86;Make sure it is warm not too scolding hot and good water pressure.;8;13
14218;1sFvWxhzyJg;1sFvWxhzyJg-8-rgb_front;1sFvWxhzyJg_4;1sFvWxhzyJg_4-8-rgb_front;30.31;33.31;Completely wet your hands all the way up to your wrist.;8;11

14224;1sIQ1SMNHqM;1sIQ1SMNHqM-8-rgb_front;1sIQ1SMNHqM_10;1sIQ1SMNHqM_10-8-rgb_front;70.08;76.59;And again, if you get a little bit on your surface or on your hands, it's just craft paint and it will wash off easily.;8;25
14225;1sIQ1SMNHqM;1sIQ1SMNHqM-8-rgb_front;1sIQ1SMNHqM_11;1sIQ1SMNHqM_11-8-rgb_front;78.26;83.25;That's one of the beauties of using this kind of paint, it goes a long way, it's inexpensive, and it's easy to clean up.;8;24
14226;1sIQ1SMNHqM;1sIQ1SMNHqM-8-rgb_front;1sIQ1SMNHqM_12;1sIQ1SMNHqM_12-8-rgb_front;86.44;92.36;You're going to see that it may take a little bit to match the exact grout color that you have, and that's why you play with the paint.;8;28
14227;1sIQ1SMNHqM;1sIQ1SMNHqM-8-rgb_front;1sIQ1SMNHqM_13;1sIQ1SMNHqM_13-8-rgb_front;92.36;95.48;It is inexpensive so you can afford to lose a little if you need to.;8;15
14228;1sIQ1SMNHqM;1sIQ1SMNHqM-8-rgb_front;1sIQ1SMNHqM_14;1sIQ1SMNHqM_14-8-rgb_front;96.5;104.65;I like to put a little bit on any kind of white surface, a piece of paper, a piece of cardboard, as long as it's white, so that you're working in the same color range.;8;35
14229;1sIQ1SMNHqM;1sIQ1SMNHqM-8-rgb_front;1sIQ1SMNHqM_15;1sIQ1SMNHqM_15-8-rgb_front;104.98;114.33;Put a little bit on your paper, and then walk it over to your wall and see if you're close to the grout color, if not, just keep adjusting your paint color.;8;32
14230;1sIQ1SMNHqM;1sIQ1SMNHqM-8-rgb_front;1sIQ1SMNHqM_16;1sIQ1SMNHqM_16-8-rgb_front;114.75;132.22;Use a little bit more white, a little bit more gray, or whatever your grout color happens to be composed of, just keep adding, keep adding, and you'll see that as you work this and walk it over to your wall, you can see, we're getting close.;8;47
14231;1sIQ1SMNHqM;1sIQ1SMNHqM-8-rgb_front;1sIQ1SMNHqM_17;1sIQ1SMNHqM_17-8-rgb_front;132.67;138.55;We may be a little dark or a little light, you just keep adjusting until you hit that color that you need there.;8;23

14233;1sIQ1SMNHqM;1sIQ1SMNHqM-8-rgb_front;1sIQ1SMNHqM_19;1sIQ1SMNHqM_19-8-rgb_front;153.29;154.62;Make sure you get a good coat.;8;7

14236;1sIQ1SMNHqM;1sIQ1SMNHqM-8-rgb_front;1sIQ1SMNHqM_21;1sIQ1SMNHqM_21-8-rgb_front;169.15;176.25;Paint the screws, make sure you keep them moving so you don't paint them in so tight that you can't use them again.;8;23

14241;1sIQ1SMNHqM;1sIQ1SMNHqM-8-rgb_front;1sIQ1SMNHqM_26;1sIQ1SMNHqM_26-8-rgb_front;208.35;210.77;Paint the edges because you probably will see some of that.;8;11

14243;1sIQ1SMNHqM;1sIQ1SMNHqM-8-rgb_front;1sIQ1SMNHqM_28;1sIQ1SMNHqM_28-8-rgb_front;222.3;223.71;See, it doesn't take much paint at all.;8;8
14244;1sIQ1SMNHqM;1sIQ1SMNHqM-8-rgb_front;1sIQ1SMNHqM_29;1sIQ1SMNHqM_29-8-rgb_front;224.79;229.92;And now, believe it or not, you've got your grout done, and we're ready to move on to the next step.;8;21
14245;1sIQ1SMNHqM;1sIQ1SMNHqM-8-rgb_front;1sIQ1SMNHqM_3;1sIQ1SMNHqM_3-8-rgb_front;15.11;22.58;That way, when you put your stone look on, it will look like the grout and the stone all came together at once.;8;23

14250;1sIQ1SMNHqM;1sIQ1SMNHqM-8-rgb_front;1sIQ1SMNHqM_8;1sIQ1SMNHqM_8-8-rgb_front;49.02;59.03;Using your little egg tray, you're going to squirt a little bit, remember a little bit goes a long way, and this is a fairly small project so you're not going to need a lot of paint.;8;37

14255;1sg84_vTrqg;1sg84_vTrqg-8-rgb_front;1sg84_vTrqg_11_12_13;1sg84_vTrqg_11_12_13-8-rgb_front;80.79;92.16;Jack knew. If he started hitting poorly, the first place he looked, did he complete his backswing? Full arm swing, full shoulder turn, full wrist hinge.;8;26
14256;1sg84_vTrqg;1sg84_vTrqg-8-rgb_front;1sg84_vTrqg_14;1sg84_vTrqg_14-8-rgb_front;95.76;107.61;And it also wouldn't hurt you, if you start hitting the ball poorly an excellent place to look first is, are you completing your backswing.;8;25
14257;1sg84_vTrqg;1sg84_vTrqg-8-rgb_front;1sg84_vTrqg_15;1sg84_vTrqg_15-8-rgb_front;108.04;119.81;Because if you're not completing your backswing, the only thoughts that will help you, is a manipulative Band-Aid that in the future is going to hurt you, more than it's going to help you.;8;34
14258;1sg84_vTrqg;1sg84_vTrqg-8-rgb_front;1sg84_vTrqg_16;1sg84_vTrqg_16-8-rgb_front;120.36;126.82;Be like Jack, you're starting to make some mistakes on the course, make sure you're completing your backswing.;8;18

14260;1sg84_vTrqg;1sg84_vTrqg-8-rgb_front;1sg84_vTrqg_3;1sg84_vTrqg_3-8-rgb_front;21.21;31.5;And by completing a backswing to him that meant extension, full arm swing, full shoulder turn, and full wrist hinge.;8;20

14263;1sg84_vTrqg;1sg84_vTrqg-8-rgb_front;1sg84_vTrqg_6;1sg84_vTrqg_6-8-rgb_front;52.67;57.73;And that's what Jack would do most of the time if he didn't complete his backswing.;8;16

14387;1uXVMh-7lmI;1uXVMh-7lmI-8-rgb_front;1uXVMh-7lmI_1;1uXVMh-7lmI_1-8-rgb_front;5.26;9.23;In this segment we'll talk about, what kind of flowers should I put in my yard?;8;16
14388;1uXVMh-7lmI;1uXVMh-7lmI-8-rgb_front;1uXVMh-7lmI_10;1uXVMh-7lmI_10-8-rgb_front;140.34;151.79;So when you're picking out plants, make sure to take in account what the leaves look like, what the fragrances are, and if they're not fragrant, if they are fragrant, and it's all about you again.;8;36
14389;1uXVMh-7lmI;1uXVMh-7lmI-8-rgb_front;1uXVMh-7lmI_11;1uXVMh-7lmI_11-8-rgb_front;151.85;157.2;I love the spots, and I love the different textures of the Cleopatra, it's gorgeous.;8;15
14390;1uXVMh-7lmI;1uXVMh-7lmI-8-rgb_front;1uXVMh-7lmI_12;1uXVMh-7lmI_12-8-rgb_front;158.98;163.68;And I love all the tropical plants that we can get away with growing in the northwest.;8;17
14391;1uXVMh-7lmI;1uXVMh-7lmI-8-rgb_front;1uXVMh-7lmI_13;1uXVMh-7lmI_13-8-rgb_front;163.95;173.04;This is my mandevilla, or my mande-villa plants, and it's just a vine, but I love the bright red flowers, and I love that humming birds really, really enjoy it.;8;30
14392;1uXVMh-7lmI;1uXVMh-7lmI-8-rgb_front;1uXVMh-7lmI_14;1uXVMh-7lmI_14-8-rgb_front;174.14;193.53;And next to that I have my gladiolus meriali, are also know as acidenthera, and I just love it, it has a nice fragrance like grape bubblegum, and it has little spots in the middle that are burgundy, that are just gorgeous, so it's a really, really, really pretty plant.;8;50
14393;1uXVMh-7lmI;1uXVMh-7lmI-8-rgb_front;1uXVMh-7lmI_15;1uXVMh-7lmI_15-8-rgb_front;193.96;198.49;But there's another ten thousand to a hundred thousand plants that we haven't talked about.;8;15
14394;1uXVMh-7lmI;1uXVMh-7lmI-8-rgb_front;1uXVMh-7lmI_16;1uXVMh-7lmI_16-8-rgb_front;199.28;228.6;So gardening to me is just like meeting everybody else that you meet in your life, you enjoy their company when they're there, and you invite them over whenever you can, but you realized that you can't possibly have every plant in the world in your garden, and it's about change, some plants stay for years and years, some plants go away after two years, but I never take it personally, because I know there's many more plants that I can meet in the future, that will enjoy my garden.;8;90
14395;1uXVMh-7lmI;1uXVMh-7lmI-8-rgb_front;1uXVMh-7lmI_17;1uXVMh-7lmI_17-8-rgb_front;229.12;261.14;So when I'm trying to decide what kind of plants to put in my garden, I look through magazines, I look through web pages, I look through different websites that have different ideas, and I realize that plants will never do the same in my yard as they do in other peoples yards, just as people will never act the same at your parties as they will at other peoples parties, but in the end, it really doesn't matter, all that matters is that you have a good time at your garden, and that's my advice, just plant plants when you can find them, and enjoy their company when you can.;8;111
14396;1uXVMh-7lmI;1uXVMh-7lmI-8-rgb_front;1uXVMh-7lmI_2;1uXVMh-7lmI_2-8-rgb_front;11.06;18.67;Now when I garden, I always remember that it's my garden, and your garden is your garden, and it's all about you.;8;22
14397;1uXVMh-7lmI;1uXVMh-7lmI-8-rgb_front;1uXVMh-7lmI_3;1uXVMh-7lmI_3-8-rgb_front;19.31;30.68;So when I'm planting flowers in my garden, I try not to take too many things too seriously, because in the end it's all about me and what I enjoy.;8;30
14398;1uXVMh-7lmI;1uXVMh-7lmI-8-rgb_front;1uXVMh-7lmI_4;1uXVMh-7lmI_4-8-rgb_front;31.23;44.5;And so, I like to look on the Internet, onto different websites that give you lots of different ideas on what to plant in your garden, but when it comes down to it, I just collect plants wherever I go, and that's a good rule of thumb.;8;47
14399;1uXVMh-7lmI;1uXVMh-7lmI-8-rgb_front;1uXVMh-7lmI_5;1uXVMh-7lmI_5-8-rgb_front;44.53;52.59;If you go to a garden center, farmers market, and you see something that you like, and you've got a sunny spot, and it will do well in the sun, plant it there.;8;33
14400;1uXVMh-7lmI;1uXVMh-7lmI-8-rgb_front;1uXVMh-7lmI_6;1uXVMh-7lmI_6-8-rgb_front;53.33;71.92;You don't always have to know the names of everybody that comes to your party to enjoy their company, so I try to remember the names of the plants that I purchase, but of course I forget some of the names, and in the end, that doesn't really matter, because all that matter is, that you enjoy your garden, because it is an extension of you.;8;66
14401;1uXVMh-7lmI;1uXVMh-7lmI-8-rgb_front;1uXVMh-7lmI_7;1uXVMh-7lmI_7-8-rgb_front;72.42;96.47;You can have a very formal garden with everything marked, and everything simple, and not very crowded, or you can have just a big summer party and a big barbecue bash, and you can mix and match all different types of plants that like the sun or the shade, and just put groups of them all over, and you can move them around later, and you don't have to be strict with it either, it's whatever you want to do.;8;80
14402;1uXVMh-7lmI;1uXVMh-7lmI-8-rgb_front;1uXVMh-7lmI_8;1uXVMh-7lmI_8-8-rgb_front;97.39;129.14;"So my favorite plants that I have in my garden, and that I would definitely recommend, are the following plants; this is my gold, millennium gold calla-lily, it likes full hot sun, and I love it because its got spotted leaves, and its got these bright lemony yellow flowers that last almost all summer long, and it will keep blooming for lots and lots of periods of time, and I love that it'll do full hot sun, more than shade, because I've got a lot of sun and it does really well.";8;92
14403;1uXVMh-7lmI;1uXVMh-7lmI-8-rgb_front;1uXVMh-7lmI_9;1uXVMh-7lmI_9-8-rgb_front;129.67;140.11;This Cleopatra canna-lily is of course one of my most favorite plants in my garden, and I've got some in the garden, I've got some in containers, I love the striped leaves.;8;32
14404;1udh8eAH5Es;1udh8eAH5Es-8-rgb_front;1udh8eAH5Es_0;1udh8eAH5Es_0-8-rgb_front;0.29;0.61;Hi!;8;1
14405;1udh8eAH5Es;1udh8eAH5Es-8-rgb_front;1udh8eAH5Es_10;1udh8eAH5Es_10-8-rgb_front;121.41;134.82;A friend and I where traveling together and came across a place that serves this garlic cloves amazing we have been looking forward every since but we where over seas.;8;30
14406;1udh8eAH5Es;1udh8eAH5Es-8-rgb_front;1udh8eAH5Es_11;1udh8eAH5Es_11-8-rgb_front;138.94;152.03;Anyway here is our garlic and we would add that to our onions and set it aside as we continue to build our ingredients and our base for our sauce.;8;30
14407;1udh8eAH5Es;1udh8eAH5Es-8-rgb_front;1udh8eAH5Es_2;1udh8eAH5Es_2-8-rgb_front;11.89;23.19;Okay now we are going to work with our garlic and once again a good way to peel garlic is to twist it and get a little pop there and then the skin would peel right off.;8;37
14408;1udh8eAH5Es;1udh8eAH5Es-8-rgb_front;1udh8eAH5Es_3;1udh8eAH5Es_3-8-rgb_front;24.47;40.52;Let's see and lets try something else I smash my garlic a lot of time before I chop it anyways but I have always been told if you take with the skin on and just hit it that is another way to get the skin off really easy.;8;48
14409;1udh8eAH5Es;1udh8eAH5Es-8-rgb_front;1udh8eAH5Es_4;1udh8eAH5Es_4-8-rgb_front;40.92;49.04;I didn't seem that easy I like my method better but there it comes.;8;14
14410;1udh8eAH5Es;1udh8eAH5Es-8-rgb_front;1udh8eAH5Es_5;1udh8eAH5Es_5-8-rgb_front;53.1;55.08;Take that part off.;8;4
14411;1udh8eAH5Es;1udh8eAH5Es-8-rgb_front;1udh8eAH5Es_6;1udh8eAH5Es_6-8-rgb_front;55.85;72.2;Anyway like I said I smash my garlic, give a little smash or if you have some gadgets you can just put it in a small chopper and chop your garlic up.;8;32
14412;1udh8eAH5Es;1udh8eAH5Es-8-rgb_front;1udh8eAH5Es_7;1udh8eAH5Es_7-8-rgb_front;72.23;84.42;Of course you can do your onions like that, you can do your bell pepper, I wouldn't suggest tomato unless you want your tomato puree more then chopped.;8;28
14413;1udh8eAH5Es;1udh8eAH5Es-8-rgb_front;1udh8eAH5Es_8;1udh8eAH5Es_8-8-rgb_front;84.77;107.11;But we would chop our garlic up give a nice and edible and in spaghetti many times or in any dish a lot of times it is not a pleasant thing to just come across a big chunk of garlic as your eating unless your like me and you like garlic you look forward to that.;8;56
14414;1udh8eAH5Es;1udh8eAH5Es-8-rgb_front;1udh8eAH5Es_9;1udh8eAH5Es_9-8-rgb_front;109.14;121.07;Anyway we can chop our garlic, garlic I love it.;8;10
14415;1wa2jHu3Jj4;1wa2jHu3Jj4-8-rgb_front;1wa2jHu3Jj4_0;1wa2jHu3Jj4_0-8-rgb_front;0.45;7.16;Now that I have carved some of my block of wood, I might want to see how it's going to look in the final image.;8;25
14416;1wa2jHu3Jj4;1wa2jHu3Jj4-8-rgb_front;1wa2jHu3Jj4_1;1wa2jHu3Jj4_1-8-rgb_front;7.63;15.69;Therefore, I can pull a proof which is, essentially, a printed image that gives me an idea of where I'm going with my block of wood.;8;26
14417;1wa2jHu3Jj4;1wa2jHu3Jj4-8-rgb_front;1wa2jHu3Jj4_2;1wa2jHu3Jj4_2-8-rgb_front;16.6;25.44;In order to do that, I'm going to first need to put some ink on my pallet and use my brayer to make a sheet of ink.;8;27
14418;1wa2jHu3Jj4;1wa2jHu3Jj4-8-rgb_front;1wa2jHu3Jj4_3;1wa2jHu3Jj4_3-8-rgb_front;28.01;33.15;I am using etching ink for my woodblocks.;8;8
14419;1wa2jHu3Jj4;1wa2jHu3Jj4-8-rgb_front;1wa2jHu3Jj4_4;1wa2jHu3Jj4_4-8-rgb_front;33.15;39.7;There are relief printmaking inks but there is a limited number of pigments available.;8;14
14420;1wa2jHu3Jj4;1wa2jHu3Jj4-8-rgb_front;1wa2jHu3Jj4_5;1wa2jHu3Jj4_5-8-rgb_front;40.3;43.34;You can use etching ink, you can use lithography ink.;8;10
14421;1wa2jHu3Jj4;1wa2jHu3Jj4-8-rgb_front;1wa2jHu3Jj4_6;1wa2jHu3Jj4_6-8-rgb_front;43.79;53.92;The only difference is in the viscosity of the ink which you can alter for your uses, for what you need.;8;21
14422;1wa2jHu3Jj4;1wa2jHu3Jj4-8-rgb_front;1wa2jHu3Jj4_7;1wa2jHu3Jj4_7-8-rgb_front;55.48;59.75;Here, this ink from the tube is just going to be perfectly fine to get what we need for this proof.;8;21
14423;1wa2jHu3Jj4;1wa2jHu3Jj4-8-rgb_front;1wa2jHu3Jj4_8;1wa2jHu3Jj4_8-8-rgb_front;60.82;85.89;So, I have put a dollop of the ink onto my pallet and in order to make the sheet of ink that I need, I'm just going to kiss a little bit of that ink with this brayer so that I can make a nice even sheet of ink for my block of wood.;8;54
14424;1wefeqn5EMk;1wefeqn5EMk-8-rgb_front;1wefeqn5EMk_10;1wefeqn5EMk_10-8-rgb_front;62.06;71.29;And then we'll do that the same with our next piece and when they're both done, we're going to put them together and cut again just to make sure that there are no large chunks of garlic.;8;37
14425;1wefeqn5EMk;1wefeqn5EMk-8-rgb_front;1wefeqn5EMk_11;1wefeqn5EMk_11-8-rgb_front;71.53;79.55;We'll move this over to the side and we'll take just a little bit of our rosemary and we'll chop it.;8;21
14426;1wefeqn5EMk;1wefeqn5EMk-8-rgb_front;1wefeqn5EMk_12;1wefeqn5EMk_12-8-rgb_front;79.55;96.39;I'm using just the little ends from that little piece is off because the stem that would be in here is very, very soft.;8;24
14427;1wefeqn5EMk;1wefeqn5EMk-8-rgb_front;1wefeqn5EMk_13;1wefeqn5EMk_13-8-rgb_front;96.39;97.54;Alright, now we're going to come back to our chicken.;8;10
14428;1wefeqn5EMk;1wefeqn5EMk-8-rgb_front;1wefeqn5EMk_14;1wefeqn5EMk_14-8-rgb_front;97.54;105.42;And, again, it's not cooked all the way but that's alright because we are going to be putting our sauce in here and then roasting it in the oven.;8;29
14429;1wefeqn5EMk;1wefeqn5EMk-8-rgb_front;1wefeqn5EMk_15;1wefeqn5EMk_15-8-rgb_front;105.96;115.02;So, we'll pull this out and we're keeping this oil in here because we don't want our garlic to burn, we just want to keep the flavor of the chicken.;8;30
14430;1wefeqn5EMk;1wefeqn5EMk-8-rgb_front;1wefeqn5EMk_16;1wefeqn5EMk_16-8-rgb_front;116.29;133.31;So, we'll add our garlic and our capicola or our prosciutto and we're going to want to add some wine, white wine, to deglaze the pan.;8;26
14431;1wefeqn5EMk;1wefeqn5EMk-8-rgb_front;1wefeqn5EMk_17;1wefeqn5EMk_17-8-rgb_front;135.37;140.27;And now that we have liquid in here, I'm going to add our fresh herbs so that they don't burn.;8;20
14432;1wefeqn5EMk;1wefeqn5EMk-8-rgb_front;1wefeqn5EMk_18;1wefeqn5EMk_18-8-rgb_front;141.37;153.04;And then to give it a little bit more flavor, we'll come back to our vegetable stock and we'll add an equal amount of that as we have with the rice.;8;31
14433;1wefeqn5EMk;1wefeqn5EMk-8-rgb_front;1wefeqn5EMk_19;1wefeqn5EMk_19-8-rgb_front;153.04;154.91;So about a half a cup to a cup each.;8;10
14434;1wefeqn5EMk;1wefeqn5EMk-8-rgb_front;1wefeqn5EMk_2;1wefeqn5EMk_2-8-rgb_front;12.89;17.79;But because we are going to be cooking this chicken a couple of times that means it's just marked.;8;19
14435;1wefeqn5EMk;1wefeqn5EMk-8-rgb_front;1wefeqn5EMk_20;1wefeqn5EMk_20-8-rgb_front;154.91;156.65;And then, we're going to let this boil and reduce.;8;10
14436;1wefeqn5EMk;1wefeqn5EMk-8-rgb_front;1wefeqn5EMk_3;1wefeqn5EMk_3-8-rgb_front;17.98;30.44;So you can see it's nice and white and move it till it's where the majority of the oil is and now we'll start preparing our sauce.;8;27
14437;1wefeqn5EMk;1wefeqn5EMk-8-rgb_front;1wefeqn5EMk_4;1wefeqn5EMk_4-8-rgb_front;31.6;36.32;So, we've already cut our capicola or our prosciutto, so we're going to take two cloves of garlic.;8;18
14438;1wefeqn5EMk;1wefeqn5EMk-8-rgb_front;1wefeqn5EMk_5;1wefeqn5EMk_5-8-rgb_front;36.36;37.3;We're going to look at each end.;8;7
14439;1wefeqn5EMk;1wefeqn5EMk-8-rgb_front;1wefeqn5EMk_6;1wefeqn5EMk_6-8-rgb_front;37.3;40.34;One end is smooth and one has like a little brown stem.;8;12
14440;1wefeqn5EMk;1wefeqn5EMk-8-rgb_front;1wefeqn5EMk_7;1wefeqn5EMk_7-8-rgb_front;41.21;47.56;So we're going to cut that off both parts and then we're going to remove them because that's about the size that we want to chop our garlic.;8;28
14441;1wefeqn5EMk;1wefeqn5EMk-8-rgb_front;1wefeqn5EMk_8;1wefeqn5EMk_8-8-rgb_front;48.72;52.45;So, we'll grab the sides and chop and then we'll do it again.;8;13
14442;1wefeqn5EMk;1wefeqn5EMk-8-rgb_front;1wefeqn5EMk_9;1wefeqn5EMk_9-8-rgb_front;52.68;62.06;See the garlic is going to rise up the edge of the knife so we'll just pull that back down.;8;20

14447;1wmA0tuWzRI;1wmA0tuWzRI-8-rgb_front;1wmA0tuWzRI_4;1wmA0tuWzRI_4-8-rgb_front;27.57;29.79;They do this by shimming.;8;5

14449;1wmA0tuWzRI;1wmA0tuWzRI-8-rgb_front;1wmA0tuWzRI_6;1wmA0tuWzRI_6-8-rgb_front;34.34;40.89;And you're going to lay your level over the corners of the table and the length.;8;16
14450;1wmA0tuWzRI;1wmA0tuWzRI-8-rgb_front;1wmA0tuWzRI_7;1wmA0tuWzRI_7-8-rgb_front;41.46;49.84;And you're going to put, if if it's low on one end, you're going to put the card on that end to try to bring that part of the slate up.;8;31
14451;1wmA0tuWzRI;1wmA0tuWzRI-8-rgb_front;1wmA0tuWzRI_8;1wmA0tuWzRI_8-8-rgb_front;50.27;58.63;It's a trial and error type method as to how many shims you need or playing cards.;8;17

14453;1wtSe0nk5Tk;1wtSe0nk5Tk-8-rgb_front;1wtSe0nk5Tk_0;1wtSe0nk5Tk_0-8-rgb_front;0.47;4.54;I would like to have a discussion on electromagnetic fields now.;8;11

14455;1wtSe0nk5Tk;1wtSe0nk5Tk-8-rgb_front;1wtSe0nk5Tk_10;1wtSe0nk5Tk_10-8-rgb_front;75.41;81.58;Also what's important to know what's behind that headboard, what's behind on the other side of the wall.;8;18
14456;1wtSe0nk5Tk;1wtSe0nk5Tk-8-rgb_front;1wtSe0nk5Tk_11;1wtSe0nk5Tk_11-8-rgb_front;81.95;91.93;I had a client who had the walls full of electronics on the other side and she had constant headaches and her immune system was really suffering and she didn't know why.;8;32
14457;1wtSe0nk5Tk;1wtSe0nk5Tk-8-rgb_front;1wtSe0nk5Tk_12;1wtSe0nk5Tk_12-8-rgb_front;92.31;102.01;So after I pointed out they actually moved electronics in the other room to the other corner and her health improved dramatically after that.;8;24
14458;1wtSe0nk5Tk;1wtSe0nk5Tk-8-rgb_front;1wtSe0nk5Tk_2;1wtSe0nk5Tk_2-8-rgb_front;8.21;13.4;So our lives are full of electronics, electronics is everywhere.;8;10
14459;1wtSe0nk5Tk;1wtSe0nk5Tk-8-rgb_front;1wtSe0nk5Tk_3;1wtSe0nk5Tk_3-8-rgb_front;13.7;20.39;So and it radiates different frequencies and we are exposed all day long to it.;8;15
14460;1wtSe0nk5Tk;1wtSe0nk5Tk-8-rgb_front;1wtSe0nk5Tk_4;1wtSe0nk5Tk_4-8-rgb_front;21.38;24.73;So our immune system is really getting bitten.;8;8
14461;1wtSe0nk5Tk;1wtSe0nk5Tk-8-rgb_front;1wtSe0nk5Tk_5;1wtSe0nk5Tk_5-8-rgb_front;25.59;32.46;And you want to have this one room in your life where you can come home at night and rest from all of the exposure.;8;25
14462;1wtSe0nk5Tk;1wtSe0nk5Tk-8-rgb_front;1wtSe0nk5Tk_6;1wtSe0nk5Tk_6-8-rgb_front;32.96;37.03;You really don't want to have too much electronics in your bedroom.;8;12

14464;1wtSe0nk5Tk;1wtSe0nk5Tk-8-rgb_front;1wtSe0nk5Tk_8;1wtSe0nk5Tk_8-8-rgb_front;55.07;67.26;So if you can Jane here has simple quartz clock that she changed from an electric clock so this is much safer.;8;22
14465;1wtSe0nk5Tk;1wtSe0nk5Tk-8-rgb_front;1wtSe0nk5Tk_9;1wtSe0nk5Tk_9-8-rgb_front;68.23;75.08;So if you really need to have that electronics in the bedroom just put it as far away from you as possible.;8;22
14480;1xl3MOjKX84;1xl3MOjKX84-8-rgb_front;1xl3MOjKX84_0;1xl3MOjKX84_0-8-rgb_front;0.1;5.02;Now, I'm going to show you the supplies we're going to need to make our paddle ball.;8;17
14481;1xl3MOjKX84;1xl3MOjKX84-8-rgb_front;1xl3MOjKX84_1;1xl3MOjKX84_1-8-rgb_front;5.95;12.73;We're going to make our handle out of cardboard, corrugated cardboard box or carton.;8;14
14482;1xl3MOjKX84;1xl3MOjKX84-8-rgb_front;1xl3MOjKX84_2;1xl3MOjKX84_2-8-rgb_front;13.32;23.89;The size of the cardboard should be big enough to make two paddles because they're going to be, actually, our one paddle is going to have two layers to it.;8;30
14483;1xl3MOjKX84;1xl3MOjKX84-8-rgb_front;1xl3MOjKX84_3;1xl3MOjKX84_3-8-rgb_front;24.25;39.63;So, take the size of the round head of the paddle that you want, using the plate of the bowl, and make sure that you have enough for two of those the same sized paddles to be cut out from that cardboard.;8;42
14484;1xl3MOjKX84;1xl3MOjKX84-8-rgb_front;1xl3MOjKX84_4;1xl3MOjKX84_4-8-rgb_front;40.05;47.07;So, we're going to need the cardboard and a plate to measure our circle for the head of the paddle.;8;20
14485;1xl3MOjKX84;1xl3MOjKX84-8-rgb_front;1xl3MOjKX84_5;1xl3MOjKX84_5-8-rgb_front;47.97;57.48;We're going to have to have a pencil on hand and a scissors, along with a paintbrush for decorating the paddle.;8;21

14487;1yEMYc7n3dU;1yEMYc7n3dU-8-rgb_front;1yEMYc7n3dU_11;1yEMYc7n3dU_11-8-rgb_front;56.48;58.46;So what is, I mean, attacking the front foot?;8;9
14488;1yEMYc7n3dU;1yEMYc7n3dU-8-rgb_front;1yEMYc7n3dU_12;1yEMYc7n3dU_12-8-rgb_front;59.15;64.44;So basically you want to position the ball towards that area, the area of the front foot, okay?;8;18
14489;1yEMYc7n3dU;1yEMYc7n3dU-8-rgb_front;1yEMYc7n3dU_13;1yEMYc7n3dU_13-8-rgb_front;65.87;86.28;Pretend that you're actually going to go one way, and then actually, while he's distracted or while he's coming at you, the moment that he's ready to stop to defend or to start moving backwards, then you pass the ball through his legs, and then you go around him as....as you receive the ball on the other end.;8;58
14490;1yEMYc7n3dU;1yEMYc7n3dU-8-rgb_front;1yEMYc7n3dU_14;1yEMYc7n3dU_14-8-rgb_front;86.85;88.84;So again, we are attacking the front foot.;8;8
14491;1yEMYc7n3dU;1yEMYc7n3dU-8-rgb_front;1yEMYc7n3dU_15;1yEMYc7n3dU_15-8-rgb_front;89.14;90.13;Why the front foot?;8;4
14492;1yEMYc7n3dU;1yEMYc7n3dU-8-rgb_front;1yEMYc7n3dU_16;1yEMYc7n3dU_16-8-rgb_front;90.88;97.12;Because that's where his weight is, and it's more difficult for him to turn this way to try to stop me, okay?;8;22
14493;1yEMYc7n3dU;1yEMYc7n3dU-8-rgb_front;1yEMYc7n3dU_17;1yEMYc7n3dU_17-8-rgb_front;97.49;110.29;But at the same time, because we know that he's going to have his legs open, okay, and I'm going to take advantage of that, I want to put right between his legs, the ball goes through the legs, and I run to the side, because I know he will have a harder time catching me.;8;56
14494;1yEMYc7n3dU;1yEMYc7n3dU-8-rgb_front;1yEMYc7n3dU_18;1yEMYc7n3dU_18-8-rgb_front;110.82;111.15;Okay?;8;1

14496;1yEMYc7n3dU;1yEMYc7n3dU-8-rgb_front;1yEMYc7n3dU_20;1yEMYc7n3dU_20-8-rgb_front;115.46;117.7;Pretend that at a park, you know, let 'em do it.;8;11

14506;1yckSw3bsVs;1yckSw3bsVs-8-rgb_front;1yckSw3bsVs_4;1yckSw3bsVs_4-8-rgb_front;34.22;35.91;So it looks something like this.;8;6
14507;1yckSw3bsVs;1yckSw3bsVs-8-rgb_front;1yckSw3bsVs_5;1yckSw3bsVs_5-8-rgb_front;41.89;48.46;Now, it's not always easy but if you practice this for a while eventually you should be able to do it without too much trouble.;8;25
14508;1ypYKgSPHkA;1ypYKgSPHkA-8-rgb_front;1ypYKgSPHkA_0;1ypYKgSPHkA_0-8-rgb_front;0.36;6.5;Okay there are some important, important regulations when it comes to stepping over the sidelines of the piste.;8;18
14509;1ypYKgSPHkA;1ypYKgSPHkA-8-rgb_front;1ypYKgSPHkA_1;1ypYKgSPHkA_1-8-rgb_front;6.53;15.42;So if in the course of a bout, one fencer slips over the edge, with one or both feet, a halt is always called by the referee.;8;27
14510;1ypYKgSPHkA;1ypYKgSPHkA-8-rgb_front;1ypYKgSPHkA_10;1ypYKgSPHkA_10-8-rgb_front;73.2;82.51;If my armor had already been extended, and I had been in mid-attack and touched, even just after I had stepped off with one foot, the touch would still be in my favor.;8;33
14511;1ypYKgSPHkA;1ypYKgSPHkA-8-rgb_front;1ypYKgSPHkA_11;1ypYKgSPHkA_11-8-rgb_front;82.82;86.63;So the rules get a little bit convoluted but it's important to remember, first of all, to stay on the strip.;8;21
14512;1ypYKgSPHkA;1ypYKgSPHkA-8-rgb_front;1ypYKgSPHkA_12;1ypYKgSPHkA_12-8-rgb_front;87.39;101.38;Second of all, that it's better to step off with one foot, than with two feet, if possible, and also that the score will also go in your opponent's favor if you step off the, the piste.;8;37
14513;1ypYKgSPHkA;1ypYKgSPHkA-8-rgb_front;1ypYKgSPHkA_13;1ypYKgSPHkA_13-8-rgb_front;101.65;106.15;So you want to remember to at all costs, keep your feet within the lines.;8;15
14514;1ypYKgSPHkA;1ypYKgSPHkA-8-rgb_front;1ypYKgSPHkA_2;1ypYKgSPHkA_2-8-rgb_front;15.78;29.77;So, in the event that in the action I slipped off with both feet, say I was getting a little overzealous in a repost and crossed over, lost my balance in a lunge, and ended up off to the side, a halt would be called.;8;45
14515;1ypYKgSPHkA;1ypYKgSPHkA-8-rgb_front;1ypYKgSPHkA_3;1ypYKgSPHkA_3-8-rgb_front;30.42;33.18;If I had scored a touch, it would not count.;8;10

14518;1ypYKgSPHkA;1ypYKgSPHkA-8-rgb_front;1ypYKgSPHkA_6;1ypYKgSPHkA_6-8-rgb_front;47.43;50.53;The same rules would hold true, my touch would not count.;8;11
14519;1ypYKgSPHkA;1ypYKgSPHkA-8-rgb_front;1ypYKgSPHkA_7;1ypYKgSPHkA_7-8-rgb_front;50.78;55.78;Even if we both touched at the same time, Siri would score a point, a touch, but I would not.;8;20

14521;1ypYKgSPHkA;1ypYKgSPHkA-8-rgb_front;1ypYKgSPHkA_9;1ypYKgSPHkA_9-8-rgb_front;60.28;73.17;There is an exception here however, whereas if I had begun the action, before I stepped off the sidelines, which is to say if I'd established right-of-way, and actually legally begun the attack, in that case it probably would have been true.;8;42

14592;1zQf384LX3M;1zQf384LX3M-8-rgb_front;1zQf384LX3M_4;1zQf384LX3M_4-8-rgb_front;12.39;16.12;From here you are going to open out to the side so you are going to make sure that your shoulder is completely in line.;8;25
14593;1zQf384LX3M;1zQf384LX3M-8-rgb_front;1zQf384LX3M_5;1zQf384LX3M_5-8-rgb_front;16.39;23.25;You don't want it above or below but straight in line with that shoulder and then you are going to slowly start to turn your body out to the left side.;8;31
14594;1zQf384LX3M;1zQf384LX3M-8-rgb_front;1zQf384LX3M_6;1zQf384LX3M_6-8-rgb_front;23.52;30.45;As you are pressing the shoulder down into the wall and you don't have to turn the shoulder very much here but it is a good shoulder to open up that chest.;8;32
14595;1zQf384LX3M;1zQf384LX3M-8-rgb_front;1zQf384LX3M_7;1zQf384LX3M_7-8-rgb_front;31.2;39.1;Good, take a deep inhale here and try to twist a little bit more as you straighten the body all the way, good and then come back to center.;8;29
14596;1zQf384LX3M;1zQf384LX3M-8-rgb_front;1zQf384LX3M_8;1zQf384LX3M_8-8-rgb_front;39.97;45.94;Face the wall again and make sure you lift the arms straight up and then lower it right back down to your side.;8;23

14599;1zRg1-tq9Uc;1zRg1-tq9Uc-8-rgb_front;1zRg1-tq9Uc_1;1zRg1-tq9Uc_1-8-rgb_front;2.87;8.65;It's good to reiterate when we're moving along and using, specifically with something that has a pattern in it or not.;8;21
14600;1zRg1-tq9Uc;1zRg1-tq9Uc-8-rgb_front;1zRg1-tq9Uc_10;1zRg1-tq9Uc_10-8-rgb_front;53.4;56.01;I'm just going to cut out a small piece to give you an example.;8;14

14603;1zRg1-tq9Uc;1zRg1-tq9Uc-8-rgb_front;1zRg1-tq9Uc_13;1zRg1-tq9Uc_13-8-rgb_front;66.54;68.36;Its going to create a value shift.;8;7
14604;1zRg1-tq9Uc;1zRg1-tq9Uc-8-rgb_front;1zRg1-tq9Uc_14;1zRg1-tq9Uc_14-8-rgb_front;68.58;69.51;Or give a line.;8;4

14607;1zRg1-tq9Uc;1zRg1-tq9Uc-8-rgb_front;1zRg1-tq9Uc_2;1zRg1-tq9Uc_2-8-rgb_front;9.65;12.22;You want to make sure that you are paying attention to the value tones.;8;14

14609;1zRg1-tq9Uc;1zRg1-tq9Uc-8-rgb_front;1zRg1-tq9Uc_4;1zRg1-tq9Uc_4-8-rgb_front;19.45;25.17;I don't want to be thinking this is just a certain area for muddled color and I don't need to be paying attention to those things.;8;26

14611;1zRg1-tq9Uc;1zRg1-tq9Uc-8-rgb_front;1zRg1-tq9Uc_6;1zRg1-tq9Uc_6-8-rgb_front;28.27;32.83;I'm looking at though and I'm thinking to myself, it looks nice, I like the color of it.;8;18
14612;1zRg1-tq9Uc;1zRg1-tq9Uc-8-rgb_front;1zRg1-tq9Uc_7;1zRg1-tq9Uc_7-8-rgb_front;33.13;42.95;But I don't exactly see any shifts in value that are intriguing to me enough to show that if this is the wrist laying on top of the knee, why isn't there any value shifts inside of it?;8;38
14613;1zRg1-tq9Uc;1zRg1-tq9Uc-8-rgb_front;1zRg1-tq9Uc_8;1zRg1-tq9Uc_8-8-rgb_front;43.15;51.28;So I may actually just lay this piece down, but begin to lay some layers over on top of it to have a little more shift in value.;8;28

15008;221LE0VXCB8;221LE0VXCB8-8-rgb_front;221LE0VXCB8_4;221LE0VXCB8_4-8-rgb_front;41.03;46.73;Sometimes one tooth on either side is adequate or the teeth are very small, which in this case they are.;8;20

15011;221LE0VXCB8;221LE0VXCB8-8-rgb_front;221LE0VXCB8_7;221LE0VXCB8_7-8-rgb_front;64.25;70.86;If you were to go all the way from cuspid to cuspid these two teeth could probably do the work of six.;8;22
15012;221LE0VXCB8;221LE0VXCB8-8-rgb_front;221LE0VXCB8_8;221LE0VXCB8_8-8-rgb_front;71.67;76.05;But it's very unlikely that these two small teeth here could do the work of four.;8;16

15138;23GbjIU50qw;23GbjIU50qw-8-rgb_front;23GbjIU50qw_20;23GbjIU50qw_20-8-rgb_front;81.78;85.77;I already put mine in my in my canester, so we'll talk it out together.;8;15

15628;2OuMczapT_M;2OuMczapT_M-8-rgb_front;2OuMczapT_M_5;2OuMczapT_M_5-8-rgb_front;45.09;51.64;A minus eleven bat for instance would be if it were a thirty inch bat, would be a nineteen ounce bat.;8;21

15630;2OuMczapT_M;2OuMczapT_M-8-rgb_front;2OuMczapT_M_7;2OuMczapT_M_7-8-rgb_front;61.38;70.89;Usually the smaller the player the more minus there is, the lighter the bat is and usually the larger the player the heavier the bat would be.;8;27
15631;2OuMczapT_M;2OuMczapT_M-8-rgb_front;2OuMczapT_M_8;2OuMczapT_M_8-8-rgb_front;71.58;84.51;Most players in the high school level on up until they start using wood, and get into professional baseball, use minus three exclusively because it is a rule for high school and college.;8;33
15632;2OuMczapT_M;2OuMczapT_M-8-rgb_front;2OuMczapT_M_9;2OuMczapT_M_9-8-rgb_front;84.74;92.33;So a minus three bat would a thirty two twenty nine, or a thirty three thirty, because it's three ounces lighter than the length.;8;24
15633;2QE61mte5v4;2QE61mte5v4-8-rgb_front;2QE61mte5v4_1;2QE61mte5v4_1-8-rgb_front;7.67;18.99;Ok, for our next point now, we need to decide about the hair style, whatever the customer has decided how he would like his hair to go.;8;27
15634;2QE61mte5v4;2QE61mte5v4-8-rgb_front;2QE61mte5v4_10;2QE61mte5v4_10-8-rgb_front;87.94;94.0;So with the customer having a parting, he obviously is not going have the hair going straight forward or going back.;8;21
15635;2QE61mte5v4;2QE61mte5v4-8-rgb_front;2QE61mte5v4_11;2QE61mte5v4_11-8-rgb_front;94.39;101.32;So we still need to give some indication to our wig maker on what kind of style the customer is going to have.;8;23
15636;2QE61mte5v4;2QE61mte5v4-8-rgb_front;2QE61mte5v4_12;2QE61mte5v4_12-8-rgb_front;101.82;111.76;So, what I'm going to do now is actually put the indication of the flow of the hair, so we want the hair to go around like this.;8;28
15637;2QE61mte5v4;2QE61mte5v4-8-rgb_front;2QE61mte5v4_13;2QE61mte5v4_13-8-rgb_front;114.25;128.81;Now the reason I'm putting this slight curve into this is that any good wig maker will actually out each individual hair into the hair piece so it gradually starts to go back.;8;33
15638;2QE61mte5v4;2QE61mte5v4-8-rgb_front;2QE61mte5v4_14;2QE61mte5v4_14-8-rgb_front;129.2;130.98;Same with this point of parting.;8;6
15639;2QE61mte5v4;2QE61mte5v4-8-rgb_front;2QE61mte5v4_15;2QE61mte5v4_15-8-rgb_front;131.4;142.38;We don't want the hair being put into the base of the piece pointing this way, what we want is for the hair to be slightly pointed this way in the hair piece.;8;33
15640;2QE61mte5v4;2QE61mte5v4-8-rgb_front;2QE61mte5v4_16;2QE61mte5v4_16-8-rgb_front;145.17;155.63;When the customer has a parting, the hair is going to flow backwards, and not forwards pushing itself onto the face.;8;21
15641;2QE61mte5v4;2QE61mte5v4-8-rgb_front;2QE61mte5v4_17;2QE61mte5v4_17-8-rgb_front;156.6;166.07;A real head of hair tends to act differently than a hair piece, so you really do have to give the hair piece direction, which way to go.;8;28
15642;2QE61mte5v4;2QE61mte5v4-8-rgb_front;2QE61mte5v4_18;2QE61mte5v4_18-8-rgb_front;166.73;172.16;So as I say, giving the hair direction like so.;8;10
15643;2QE61mte5v4;2QE61mte5v4-8-rgb_front;2QE61mte5v4_19;2QE61mte5v4_19-8-rgb_front;173.08;180.84;So the hair piece is going to sweep around like this, the hair will come over the forehead and sweep around.;8;21
15644;2QE61mte5v4;2QE61mte5v4-8-rgb_front;2QE61mte5v4_2;2QE61mte5v4_2-8-rgb_front;19.3;22.28;So, we're going to say for instance that this customer wants a parting.;8;13
15645;2QE61mte5v4;2QE61mte5v4-8-rgb_front;2QE61mte5v4_3;2QE61mte5v4_3-8-rgb_front;23.31;30.36;Now, a parting should never begin higher that where the hairline begins on the hair piece.;8;16
15646;2QE61mte5v4;2QE61mte5v4-8-rgb_front;2QE61mte5v4_4;2QE61mte5v4_4-8-rgb_front;30.63;35.59;So, you can see the hair through here, this is where we want to begin the parting.;8;17
15647;2QE61mte5v4;2QE61mte5v4-8-rgb_front;2QE61mte5v4_5;2QE61mte5v4_5-8-rgb_front;35.85;44.06;If we began the parting here, then what would happen is when we get the hair piece back, we are going to have hair going over skin.;8;27
15648;2QE61mte5v4;2QE61mte5v4-8-rgb_front;2QE61mte5v4_6;2QE61mte5v4_6-8-rgb_front;44.52;57.07;And unfortunately, even though these hair pieces are good, they're not so good that it doesn't actually show the hair going over the skin, it tends to give the hair piece away.;8;32
15649;2QE61mte5v4;2QE61mte5v4-8-rgb_front;2QE61mte5v4_7;2QE61mte5v4_7-8-rgb_front;57.66;64.59;So, my suggestion for that is always to have the parting to begin wherever the hairline begins.;8;17
15650;2QE61mte5v4;2QE61mte5v4-8-rgb_front;2QE61mte5v4_8;2QE61mte5v4_8-8-rgb_front;64.83;67.23;So, that would be at this point.;8;7
15651;2QE61mte5v4;2QE61mte5v4-8-rgb_front;2QE61mte5v4_9;2QE61mte5v4_9-8-rgb_front;68.06;84.33;So, the customer wants a parting, so what I'm going to do is put a dotted line here and all the way back to about just the tip of the crown.;8;31

15683;2VaCIOSpIWc;2VaCIOSpIWc-8-rgb_front;2VaCIOSpIWc_3;2VaCIOSpIWc_3-8-rgb_front;8.41;15.08;One thing that can make a toy dangerous if it's part come off the toy.;8;15

16052;2nOClTVZ-0w;2nOClTVZ-0w-8-rgb_front;2nOClTVZ-0w_15;2nOClTVZ-0w_15-8-rgb_front;85.57;92.78;My name is Sylvia Russell, and this is how you can use home remedies to get rid of eye puffiness and under eye circles.;8;24

16054;2nOClTVZ-0w;2nOClTVZ-0w-8-rgb_front;2nOClTVZ-0w_3;2nOClTVZ-0w_3-8-rgb_front;17.58;23.03;The eye area is very sensitive, so we don't want to use anything that's going to damage or irritate the eye.;8;21
16055;2nOClTVZ-0w;2nOClTVZ-0w-8-rgb_front;2nOClTVZ-0w_4_5;2nOClTVZ-0w_4_5-8-rgb_front;24.07;34.22;One tip for under-eye circles or puffiness is to use a cold compress. Take a washcloth, wet it down with some water, and put it in your freezer for a few minutes.;8;32
16056;2nOClTVZ-0w;2nOClTVZ-0w-8-rgb_front;2nOClTVZ-0w_6;2nOClTVZ-0w_6-8-rgb_front;34.51;41.6;Then, once it's done lay it on your eyes for five to ten minutes, giving yourself a little mini eye mask.;8;21
16057;2nOClTVZ-0w;2nOClTVZ-0w-8-rgb_front;2nOClTVZ-0w_7_8;2nOClTVZ-0w_7_8-8-rgb_front;41.84;54.14;This is a great way to take any puffiness that has accumulated around the eye. Another great way to reduce eye puffiness is to cut some cucumbers that have been in the refrigerator and place these on the eye.;8;39
16058;2nOClTVZ-0w;2nOClTVZ-0w-8-rgb_front;2nOClTVZ-0w_9_10;2nOClTVZ-0w_9_10-8-rgb_front;54.42;69.45;These are a great way to reduce eye puffiness, but it also looks very spa-like. Another remedy is to make sure that you analyze the eye very well, and figure out the reason why you may be puffy, or why you may have under-eye circles.;8;45

16076;2oU9Ea0gGsA;2oU9Ea0gGsA-8-rgb_front;2oU9Ea0gGsA_1;2oU9Ea0gGsA_1-8-rgb_front;8.57;9.83;We call that inverted.;8;4

16078;2oU9Ea0gGsA;2oU9Ea0gGsA-8-rgb_front;2oU9Ea0gGsA_2;2oU9Ea0gGsA_2-8-rgb_front;10.17;12.09;Now, there's several different ways you can do that.;8;9
16079;2oU9Ea0gGsA;2oU9Ea0gGsA-8-rgb_front;2oU9Ea0gGsA_3;2oU9Ea0gGsA_3-8-rgb_front;12.33;16.63;Actually, some people find this roll to be easier than the right side up roll.;8;15

16082;2oU9Ea0gGsA;2oU9Ea0gGsA-8-rgb_front;2oU9Ea0gGsA_6;2oU9Ea0gGsA_6-8-rgb_front;25.75;32.4;Do a half a roll first and then you can do three quarters of a roll and then you can do a full roll.;8;24

16112;2q5qGVs_7Wo;2q5qGVs_7Wo-8-rgb_front;2q5qGVs_7Wo_4;2q5qGVs_7Wo_4-8-rgb_front;26.06;30.09;That way, they can help you pick a fish a little bit more clearly.;8;14

16125;2qYc4PAW72o;2qYc4PAW72o-8-rgb_front;2qYc4PAW72o_4;2qYc4PAW72o_4-8-rgb_front;27.63;33.42;Now if you've got a good shooting center that can come up and flash in the high post, get the ball, turn and score.;8;24

17114;3aKE_Fh3JaQ;3aKE_Fh3JaQ-8-rgb_front;3aKE_Fh3JaQ_5;3aKE_Fh3JaQ_5-8-rgb_front;45.64;57.42;This grip is very good for forehands, some players use it for serves but as you start getting better you are probably just going to use it for forehand.;8;29

17129;3dCgOOUXZBY;3dCgOOUXZBY-8-rgb_front;3dCgOOUXZBY_1;3dCgOOUXZBY_1-8-rgb_front;14.66;24.7;What you really want to do is find the ideal point, probably pretty close to the end that knock back and forth and spins the stick just around the center point, around this middle point of the stick right there.;8;40
17130;3dCgOOUXZBY;3dCgOOUXZBY-8-rgb_front;3dCgOOUXZBY_10;3dCgOOUXZBY_10-8-rgb_front;73.84;74.76;Then we'll move on from there.;8;6

17784;46WKIipNJt8;46WKIipNJt8-8-rgb_front;46WKIipNJt8_13;46WKIipNJt8_13-8-rgb_front;121.55;127.68;Usually I only need three, this is quite a large pot, some larger pot require more.;8;16

17786;46WKIipNJt8;46WKIipNJt8-8-rgb_front;46WKIipNJt8_15;46WKIipNJt8_15-8-rgb_front;132.65;133.97;I'm sticking it to the back.;8;6

17788;46WKIipNJt8;46WKIipNJt8-8-rgb_front;46WKIipNJt8_17;46WKIipNJt8_17-8-rgb_front;143.6;147.68;Okay, so now we have centered and secured our plant pot.;8;11
17789;46WKIipNJt8;46WKIipNJt8-8-rgb_front;46WKIipNJt8_18;46WKIipNJt8_18-8-rgb_front;147.71;151.79;The next thing is going to be trimming the foot and I will talk about that next.;8;17

17791;46WKIipNJt8;46WKIipNJt8-8-rgb_front;46WKIipNJt8_3;46WKIipNJt8_3-8-rgb_front;15.85;28.88;Now, what I'm going to do is turn the plant pot on the wheel and take my pin tool and steady my hands up and let the pin tool touch the pot.;8;32
17792;46WKIipNJt8;46WKIipNJt8-8-rgb_front;46WKIipNJt8_4;46WKIipNJt8_4-8-rgb_front;33.02;40.0;Now as you can see, the pin tool is making a mark, that to there.;8;15
17793;46WKIipNJt8;46WKIipNJt8-8-rgb_front;46WKIipNJt8_5;46WKIipNJt8_5-8-rgb_front;41.46;63.4;Now what I do with this mark, I face it towards me, I put a finger on each side of our mark, it's right there and right there and I'm simply going to push the pot away from me and then I'm going to re-check.;8;45
17794;46WKIipNJt8;46WKIipNJt8-8-rgb_front;46WKIipNJt8_6;46WKIipNJt8_6-8-rgb_front;63.4;70.38;Okay, so you can see right there, the navel is pretty much going, making a full circle around the pot.;8;20
17795;46WKIipNJt8;46WKIipNJt8-8-rgb_front;46WKIipNJt8_7;46WKIipNJt8_7-8-rgb_front;71.57;75.26;The more of center the pot will be, the smaller your line will be.;8;14

17797;46WKIipNJt8;46WKIipNJt8-8-rgb_front;46WKIipNJt8_9;46WKIipNJt8_9-8-rgb_front;79.35;92.55;So now we have the pot centered on the wheel, the next thing is going to be securing it and I just want to get a little bit of moisture on this wheel so that clay will stick.;8;38

17844;476vh2-HlV0;476vh2-HlV0-8-rgb_front;476vh2-HlV0_10;476vh2-HlV0_10-8-rgb_front;38.91;51.92;Secondly, because it is metal, while it's made to use in your microwave, it can still cause problems, so you want to not use it, not leave it in there as much as possible.;8;34
17846;476vh2-HlV0;476vh2-HlV0-8-rgb_front;476vh2-HlV0_11;476vh2-HlV0_11-8-rgb_front;53.08;62.51;Also, you want to make sure that when you're cleaning this, you're particularly careful about cleaning corners where it's going to be touching the microwave walls.;8;26
17848;476vh2-HlV0;476vh2-HlV0-8-rgb_front;476vh2-HlV0_12;476vh2-HlV0_12-8-rgb_front;63.3;67.88;All of this will be in your microwave owner's manual.;8;10
17850;476vh2-HlV0;476vh2-HlV0-8-rgb_front;476vh2-HlV0_13;476vh2-HlV0_13-8-rgb_front;69.17;72.96;You just want to make sure and get this all nice and clean.;8;13
17852;476vh2-HlV0;476vh2-HlV0-8-rgb_front;476vh2-HlV0_14;476vh2-HlV0_14-8-rgb_front;74.17;80.25;Even if you keep this in your microwave most of the time, it probably still won't get that dirty unless you've got exploding food all the time.;8;27
17854;476vh2-HlV0;476vh2-HlV0-8-rgb_front;476vh2-HlV0_15;476vh2-HlV0_15-8-rgb_front;80.6;82.28;This should be one of the easier steps.;8;8
17856;476vh2-HlV0;476vh2-HlV0-8-rgb_front;476vh2-HlV0_16;476vh2-HlV0_16-8-rgb_front;82.85;88.09;We're just going to rinse it off and then put it to the side to dry.;8;16
17858;476vh2-HlV0;476vh2-HlV0-8-rgb_front;476vh2-HlV0_2;476vh2-HlV0_2-8-rgb_front;8.71;11.74;Our next step is going to be cleaning the microwave oven rack.;8;12
17860;476vh2-HlV0;476vh2-HlV0-8-rgb_front;476vh2-HlV0_3;476vh2-HlV0_3-8-rgb_front;12.97;16.37;This is going to be the same process as cleaning the turn table.;8;13
17862;476vh2-HlV0;476vh2-HlV0-8-rgb_front;476vh2-HlV0_4;476vh2-HlV0_4-8-rgb_front;16.87;18.55;Let me get this wet first.;8;6
17864;476vh2-HlV0;476vh2-HlV0-8-rgb_front;476vh2-HlV0_5;476vh2-HlV0_5-8-rgb_front;19.68;20.51;Spray that down.;8;3
17866;476vh2-HlV0;476vh2-HlV0-8-rgb_front;476vh2-HlV0_6;476vh2-HlV0_6-8-rgb_front;22.02;27.92;Then just use your mild dish soap that you would use for cleaning your dishes and silverware.;8;17
17868;476vh2-HlV0;476vh2-HlV0-8-rgb_front;476vh2-HlV0_7;476vh2-HlV0_7-8-rgb_front;28.39;29.56;You're going to wipe this down.;8;6
17870;476vh2-HlV0;476vh2-HlV0-8-rgb_front;476vh2-HlV0_8;476vh2-HlV0_8-8-rgb_front;30.08;35.37;As I mentioned earlier, in general, you should not leave the rack in the microwave.;8;15
17872;476vh2-HlV0;476vh2-HlV0-8-rgb_front;476vh2-HlV0_9;476vh2-HlV0_9-8-rgb_front;35.49;38.14;First of all, this helps prevent it from getting dirty.;8;10
17873;477ZE29Y6eU;477ZE29Y6eU-8-rgb_front;477ZE29Y6eU_1;477ZE29Y6eU_1-8-rgb_front;10.17;15.95;Now some of the parts that you might add to your winter horse blanket are called hoods and neck covers.;8;20
17874;477ZE29Y6eU;477ZE29Y6eU-8-rgb_front;477ZE29Y6eU_10;477ZE29Y6eU_10-8-rgb_front;80.8;91.64;This net cover will go right over the top of the head and then the blanket has buckles and the neck cover has straps.;8;24
17875;477ZE29Y6eU;477ZE29Y6eU-8-rgb_front;477ZE29Y6eU_11;477ZE29Y6eU_11-8-rgb_front;91.64;101.94;So what we're going to do is just need apply the straps to the blanket and secure the neck cover in place.;8;22
17876;477ZE29Y6eU;477ZE29Y6eU-8-rgb_front;477ZE29Y6eU_12;477ZE29Y6eU_12-8-rgb_front;101.94;103.44;Why would your horse need a neck cover?;8;8
17877;477ZE29Y6eU;477ZE29Y6eU-8-rgb_front;477ZE29Y6eU_13;477ZE29Y6eU_13-8-rgb_front;103.44;115.84;Well if he's outside and it rains a lot or snows a lot on him the blanket might be waterproof but the problem is that sometimes it rains or snows on their neck and melts and it can still get down into your blanket.;8;44
17878;477ZE29Y6eU;477ZE29Y6eU-8-rgb_front;477ZE29Y6eU_14;477ZE29Y6eU_14-8-rgb_front;115.87;124.76;So you might have a waterproof blanket but if you don't have a neck cover it won't keep it from running down their neck into the horses blanket.;8;28
17879;477ZE29Y6eU;477ZE29Y6eU-8-rgb_front;477ZE29Y6eU_15;477ZE29Y6eU_15-8-rgb_front;125.11;130.83;Then it secures with fasteners in the front as well.;8;10
17880;477ZE29Y6eU;477ZE29Y6eU-8-rgb_front;477ZE29Y6eU_16;477ZE29Y6eU_16-8-rgb_front;130.86;137.3;So, that if he starts playing or running around it's pretty secure to the blanket and also in the front.;8;20
17881;477ZE29Y6eU;477ZE29Y6eU-8-rgb_front;477ZE29Y6eU_17;477ZE29Y6eU_17-8-rgb_front;137.73;146.32;Some of the hoods or net covers will have a strap that attaches to a halter so it's got even more strength for moving around.;8;25
17882;477ZE29Y6eU;477ZE29Y6eU-8-rgb_front;477ZE29Y6eU_18;477ZE29Y6eU_18-8-rgb_front;146.8;159.03;So this net cover is going to keep him pretty much covered from the elements from his neck and it won't allow any of the moisture to get down inside his blanket and run down into or on his chest or inside the blanket.;8;44
17883;477ZE29Y6eU;477ZE29Y6eU-8-rgb_front;477ZE29Y6eU_19;477ZE29Y6eU_19-8-rgb_front;159.03;165.0;So that's why you would use a net cover to keep their hair coat short or to keep out the elements from inside their blanket.;8;25
17884;477ZE29Y6eU;477ZE29Y6eU-8-rgb_front;477ZE29Y6eU_2;477ZE29Y6eU_2-8-rgb_front;16.64;21.61;Now hoods usually go down over their face so let me show you this.;8;14
17885;477ZE29Y6eU;477ZE29Y6eU-8-rgb_front;477ZE29Y6eU_3_4;477ZE29Y6eU_3_4-8-rgb_front;21.81;41.72;This one doesn't necessarily go with this blanket but will just show you how it works. It slides up over the top of their head and then comes down thru their ears and they can see through it there we go so it would fit down over their face.;8;49
17886;477ZE29Y6eU;477ZE29Y6eU-8-rgb_front;477ZE29Y6eU_5;477ZE29Y6eU_5-8-rgb_front;41.72;44.38;Now you'd say why do I need a hood for my horse.;8;12
17887;477ZE29Y6eU;477ZE29Y6eU-8-rgb_front;477ZE29Y6eU_6;477ZE29Y6eU_6-8-rgb_front;44.68;61.48;People that want that show quality shine like a lot halter horses and performance horses, show horses they want to keep them in their short hair coats all over their body all winter long so that they can keep showing them and have that summer look to them it shows off their body better.;8;54
17888;477ZE29Y6eU;477ZE29Y6eU-8-rgb_front;477ZE29Y6eU_7;477ZE29Y6eU_7-8-rgb_front;61.48;64.43;So their going to purchase a hood that covers all their body.;8;12
17889;477ZE29Y6eU;477ZE29Y6eU-8-rgb_front;477ZE29Y6eU_8;477ZE29Y6eU_8-8-rgb_front;64.43;77.96;It doesn't do much good if you're showing a horse to have him smooth and shiny up to right here and then his chest and head is hairy cause then you're going to need to body clip that and once you body clip it he's going to be cold there and then you're going to need to apply a hood.;8;60
17890;477ZE29Y6eU;477ZE29Y6eU-8-rgb_front;477ZE29Y6eU_9;477ZE29Y6eU_9-8-rgb_front;78.02;79.89;Now this a net cover.;8;5
17929;47oJoR2BC34;47oJoR2BC34-8-rgb_front;47oJoR2BC34_0;47oJoR2BC34_0-8-rgb_front;0.9;5.29;My name is Anthony Maddaloni, and I'm going to talk about how to become a medical photographer.;8;17

17931;47oJoR2BC34;47oJoR2BC34-8-rgb_front;47oJoR2BC34_10;47oJoR2BC34_10-8-rgb_front;92.39;95.38;You might be using a completely different type of set up.;8;11

17933;47oJoR2BC34;47oJoR2BC34-8-rgb_front;47oJoR2BC34_12;47oJoR2BC34_12-8-rgb_front;96.62;100.94;The other thing is to look at a lot of different types of medical photography out there.;8;17
17934;47oJoR2BC34;47oJoR2BC34-8-rgb_front;47oJoR2BC34_13;47oJoR2BC34_13-8-rgb_front;101.05;106.78;That could be medical journals, websites, and see, you know, is this something that I think I can be good at?;8;21
17935;47oJoR2BC34;47oJoR2BC34-8-rgb_front;47oJoR2BC34_14;47oJoR2BC34_14-8-rgb_front;106.78;108.47;Can I understand this type of composition?;8;7

17937;47oJoR2BC34;47oJoR2BC34-8-rgb_front;47oJoR2BC34_2;47oJoR2BC34_2-8-rgb_front;26.27;31.44;And it's more of a technical type of photography than action-based photography.;8;12
17938;47oJoR2BC34;47oJoR2BC34-8-rgb_front;47oJoR2BC34_3;47oJoR2BC34_3-8-rgb_front;31.49;40.94;And one way you might want to break into this type of photography is to go to a medical school and see what a medical school...who they use, and assist.;8;30
17939;47oJoR2BC34;47oJoR2BC34-8-rgb_front;47oJoR2BC34_4;47oJoR2BC34_4-8-rgb_front;40.94;61.18;Like any other type of photography that I talk about, really, your first little foot in the door is finding someone who does it professionally and spend a day with them and see what it's like because it might not be anything what you think it's like or it might be even better than you think it is, and you can find out that you're suited for that type of photography.;8;71
17940;47oJoR2BC34;47oJoR2BC34-8-rgb_front;47oJoR2BC34_5;47oJoR2BC34_5-8-rgb_front;61.18;68.37;Now, medical photography is a type of photography where you're probably going to be using something...a digital camera.;8;18
17941;47oJoR2BC34;47oJoR2BC34-8-rgb_front;47oJoR2BC34_6;47oJoR2BC34_6-8-rgb_front;68.37;74.84;You want to make sure that you have a digital camera that can make a nice, a rather large file because you never know what these...;8;26
17942;47oJoR2BC34;47oJoR2BC34-8-rgb_front;47oJoR2BC34_7;47oJoR2BC34_7-8-rgb_front;74.88;79.94;These could be used in a court case, they could be used for lectures, med school.;8;16

17944;47oJoR2BC34;47oJoR2BC34-8-rgb_front;47oJoR2BC34_9;47oJoR2BC34_9-8-rgb_front;85.14;92.39;You wouldn't use cameras that you would, say, use for photojournalism for medical photography.;8;14

18099;4BKUiL-ou2Q;4BKUiL-ou2Q-8-rgb_front;4BKUiL-ou2Q_10;4BKUiL-ou2Q_10-8-rgb_front;63.83;70.95;For example, very often in my market, garages are added after the home was built.;8;15
18100;4BKUiL-ou2Q;4BKUiL-ou2Q-8-rgb_front;4BKUiL-ou2Q_11;4BKUiL-ou2Q_11-8-rgb_front;71.53;91.43;Building requirements change constantly so it is entirely possible that a garage that was built fifty or sixty years ago may in fact sit over a property line, even by just a small number of inches and if that's the case and your neighbor then decides they'd like your garage removed from their property, that obviously affects the value of the home.;8;62
18101;4BKUiL-ou2Q;4BKUiL-ou2Q-8-rgb_front;4BKUiL-ou2Q_12;4BKUiL-ou2Q_12-8-rgb_front;91.91;98.52;And that's one example I can use to demonstrate the importance of having a survey performed on the property that you're purchasing.;8;22
18102;4BKUiL-ou2Q;4BKUiL-ou2Q-8-rgb_front;4BKUiL-ou2Q_3;4BKUiL-ou2Q_3-8-rgb_front;13.51;16.45;I'm going to talk to you a little bit about that and how that process works.;8;16

18110;4BZVj8FDDvY;4BZVj8FDDvY-8-rgb_front;4BZVj8FDDvY_1;4BZVj8FDDvY_1-8-rgb_front;5.8;8.17;Today we're here to talk about low maintenance gardening.;8;9
18112;4BZVj8FDDvY;4BZVj8FDDvY-8-rgb_front;4BZVj8FDDvY_10;4BZVj8FDDvY_10-8-rgb_front;42.43;57.22;So what I like to do to ensure that you get the whole root and all is use your little cultivator and dig down right next to the root and loosen it up, because if you just try to pull it you might leave a little piece of root in there and that could actually propagate new weed growth.;8;59
18114;4BZVj8FDDvY;4BZVj8FDDvY-8-rgb_front;4BZVj8FDDvY_11;4BZVj8FDDvY_11-8-rgb_front;57.29;63.63;So you want to take it, wiggle it as you pull it up and get that whole root and don't just throw the weeds on your lawn.;8;27
18116;4BZVj8FDDvY;4BZVj8FDDvY-8-rgb_front;4BZVj8FDDvY_12;4BZVj8FDDvY_12-8-rgb_front;63.99;73.32;Keep a container nearby, a box or a bucket or something, throw them in a bucket and then get rid of the weed somewhere else because if you throw it in your lawn you're probably just going to grow weed right there.;8;42
18118;4BZVj8FDDvY;4BZVj8FDDvY-8-rgb_front;4BZVj8FDDvY_2;4BZVj8FDDvY_2-8-rgb_front;8.85;13.44;Okay, now here's a subject that we don't really like to talk about or even think about and that's weeding.;8;20
18120;4BZVj8FDDvY;4BZVj8FDDvY-8-rgb_front;4BZVj8FDDvY_3;4BZVj8FDDvY_3-8-rgb_front;14.43;16.17;Every garden is going to grow weeds.;8;7
18122;4BZVj8FDDvY;4BZVj8FDDvY-8-rgb_front;4BZVj8FDDvY_4;4BZVj8FDDvY_4-8-rgb_front;16.25;17.91;There's not really much that you can do to prevent it.;8;11
18124;4BZVj8FDDvY;4BZVj8FDDvY-8-rgb_front;4BZVj8FDDvY_5;4BZVj8FDDvY_5-8-rgb_front;18.74;22.4;So my advice is to weed before you really have to weed.;8;12
18126;4BZVj8FDDvY;4BZVj8FDDvY-8-rgb_front;4BZVj8FDDvY_6;4BZVj8FDDvY_6-8-rgb_front;22.4;26.51;What I try to do is get out in my garden for 1/2 an hour a week just to weed.;8;20
18128;4BZVj8FDDvY;4BZVj8FDDvY-8-rgb_front;4BZVj8FDDvY_7;4BZVj8FDDvY_7-8-rgb_front;27.54;30.59;Another advantage of a small garden is there's not that many weeds.;8;12
18130;4BZVj8FDDvY;4BZVj8FDDvY-8-rgb_front;4BZVj8FDDvY_8;4BZVj8FDDvY_8-8-rgb_front;30.98;33.59;So don't let them get out of hand, it's not that much of a hassle.;8;15
18132;4BZVj8FDDvY;4BZVj8FDDvY-8-rgb_front;4BZVj8FDDvY_9;4BZVj8FDDvY_9-8-rgb_front;34.25;42.27;Now, you can go out and cut your weeds with a hoe, which a lot of people do and I don't like to do that cause that's just going to stimulate more weed growth.;8;34
18134;4C6UadTF65I;4C6UadTF65I-8-rgb_front;4C6UadTF65I_0;4C6UadTF65I_0-8-rgb_front;0.89;5.03;Now another thing that you can do with your wax is use it as a decorative effect.;8;17
18136;4C6UadTF65I;4C6UadTF65I-8-rgb_front;4C6UadTF65I_1;4C6UadTF65I_1-8-rgb_front;5.58;10.77;The way that that works, you go ahead and put the wax where it's needed on the pot.;8;18
18138;4C6UadTF65I;4C6UadTF65I-8-rgb_front;4C6UadTF65I_10;4C6UadTF65I_10-8-rgb_front;69.48;71.4;Which in this case, will turn dark brown.;8;8
18140;4C6UadTF65I;4C6UadTF65I-8-rgb_front;4C6UadTF65I_2;4C6UadTF65I_2-8-rgb_front;10.83;12.39;In this case, on the bottom.;8;6
18142;4C6UadTF65I;4C6UadTF65I-8-rgb_front;4C6UadTF65I_3;4C6UadTF65I_3-8-rgb_front;12.76;24.95;Now clearly we don't need the wax resist anywhere else on this pot, but what you can do is take your brush, load it up with your hot wax and make a design on the pot.;8;36
18144;4C6UadTF65I;4C6UadTF65I-8-rgb_front;4C6UadTF65I_4;4C6UadTF65I_4-8-rgb_front;24.98;25.9;It can be anything.;8;4
18146;4C6UadTF65I;4C6UadTF65I-8-rgb_front;4C6UadTF65I_5;4C6UadTF65I_5-8-rgb_front;26.93;35.27;It could be just little squiggles, you can draw an actual character, anything you have interest to put on there.;8;20
18148;4C6UadTF65I;4C6UadTF65I-8-rgb_front;4C6UadTF65I_6;4C6UadTF65I_6-8-rgb_front;37.15;48.49;And what this is going to do is when you go to dip this pot in the glaze, which I'll demonstrate in a moment, this glaze will resist, I mean this wax will resist the glaze.;8;36
18150;4C6UadTF65I;4C6UadTF65I-8-rgb_front;4C6UadTF65I_7;4C6UadTF65I_7-8-rgb_front;48.77;52.34;You'll be left with bare clay anywhere that you've brushed this wax.;8;12
18152;4C6UadTF65I;4C6UadTF65I-8-rgb_front;4C6UadTF65I_8;4C6UadTF65I_8-8-rgb_front;52.62;61.92;But what's kind of cool about it is usually, your glaze is going to have kind of a halo edge around every place where it stops.;8;26
18154;4C6UadTF65I;4C6UadTF65I-8-rgb_front;4C6UadTF65I_9;4C6UadTF65I_9-8-rgb_front;62.21;69.48;So you'll have your glaze, a little bit of a halo seeping into the wax area, and then these nice decorative areas that you've left blank.;8;26

18237;4H7wucScIRg;4H7wucScIRg-8-rgb_front;4H7wucScIRg_5;4H7wucScIRg_5-8-rgb_front;58.29;64.77;And just stay attentive to it, always pay attention to it cause you don't really want it to burn.;8;19

18241;4H7wucScIRg;4H7wucScIRg-8-rgb_front;4H7wucScIRg_7;4H7wucScIRg_7-8-rgb_front;79.63;96.32;And if while you're doing this your oil starts to pop, it means that the heat is too high, just turn it down a notch and keep going.;8;28

18247;4I2azcR2kcA;4I2azcR2kcA-8-rgb_front;4I2azcR2kcA_11;4I2azcR2kcA_11-8-rgb_front;70.91;74.62;A fish may show signs of rapid breathing.;8;8

18249;4I2azcR2kcA;4I2azcR2kcA-8-rgb_front;4I2azcR2kcA_13;4I2azcR2kcA_13-8-rgb_front;78.15;82.43;These will be other ways of trying to identify whether your fish is sick.;8;14
18250;4I2azcR2kcA;4I2azcR2kcA-8-rgb_front;4I2azcR2kcA_14;4I2azcR2kcA_14-8-rgb_front;82.53;90.66;Again, it's important to try to keep an eye on your fish regularly, to see how he normally behaves, and how he normally looks.;8;24
18251;4I2azcR2kcA;4I2azcR2kcA-8-rgb_front;4I2azcR2kcA_15;4I2azcR2kcA_15-8-rgb_front;91.97;99.06;Sometimes, it would also behoove you, to do a little bit of research on the type of fish you have, to see what common ailments they do suffer from.;8;29
18252;4I2azcR2kcA;4I2azcR2kcA-8-rgb_front;4I2azcR2kcA_16;4I2azcR2kcA_16-8-rgb_front;99.66;103.11;That way, it will help you to identify when that fish is sick.;8;13
18253;4I2azcR2kcA;4I2azcR2kcA-8-rgb_front;4I2azcR2kcA_17;4I2azcR2kcA_17-8-rgb_front;103.71;106.1;Again, this is how you can tell if a fish is sick.;8;12
18254;4I2azcR2kcA;4I2azcR2kcA-8-rgb_front;4I2azcR2kcA_18;4I2azcR2kcA_18-8-rgb_front;106.2;111.32;My name is Chris, with Aquatic Central, here in San Francisco, and on the web at: aquatic-central.com.;8;17

18256;4I2azcR2kcA;4I2azcR2kcA-8-rgb_front;4I2azcR2kcA_3;4I2azcR2kcA_3-8-rgb_front;21.89;24.9;That way, you will be able to distinguish when there are differences.;8;12
18257;4I2azcR2kcA;4I2azcR2kcA-8-rgb_front;4I2azcR2kcA_4;4I2azcR2kcA_4-8-rgb_front;25.62;33.61;Usually, there will be either fungus, bacteria, or parasitic diseases, or infections.;8;12
18258;4I2azcR2kcA;4I2azcR2kcA-8-rgb_front;4I2azcR2kcA_5;4I2azcR2kcA_5-8-rgb_front;34.69;41.41;Most of them can be identified by a visual inspection, either by white tufts, or cottony growths.;8;17
18259;4I2azcR2kcA;4I2azcR2kcA-8-rgb_front;4I2azcR2kcA_6;4I2azcR2kcA_6-8-rgb_front;41.41;44.23;There could be small animals growing on your fish.;8;9
18260;4I2azcR2kcA;4I2azcR2kcA-8-rgb_front;4I2azcR2kcA_7;4I2azcR2kcA_7-8-rgb_front;44.47;53.72;There could be a loss of coloration, a loss of scale, or rotting, decaying fins.;8;15
18261;4I2azcR2kcA;4I2azcR2kcA-8-rgb_front;4I2azcR2kcA_8;4I2azcR2kcA_8-8-rgb_front;54.11;58.69;Usually, it's pretty easy to tell when a fish is sick.;8;11
18262;4I2azcR2kcA;4I2azcR2kcA-8-rgb_front;4I2azcR2kcA_9;4I2azcR2kcA_9-8-rgb_front;59.24;64.9;Sometimes, there will be more innocuous symptoms, which will require just behavioral monitoring.;8;13
18263;4K6kvm-NRYQ;4K6kvm-NRYQ-8-rgb_front;4K6kvm-NRYQ_1;4K6kvm-NRYQ_1-8-rgb_front;6.66;10.79;Now the first step in finding a good mechanic is you can talk with your friends.;8;16
18264;4K6kvm-NRYQ;4K6kvm-NRYQ-8-rgb_front;4K6kvm-NRYQ_10;4K6kvm-NRYQ_10-8-rgb_front;83.92;91.75;Which means that the mechanics have passed a test that says that they have the mechanic skills that are required, hopefully to fix your vehicle.;8;25
18265;4K6kvm-NRYQ;4K6kvm-NRYQ-8-rgb_front;4K6kvm-NRYQ_11;4K6kvm-NRYQ_11-8-rgb_front;92.75;97.09;And also you can look up if the shop is triple A accredited.;8;13
18266;4K6kvm-NRYQ;4K6kvm-NRYQ-8-rgb_front;4K6kvm-NRYQ_12;4K6kvm-NRYQ_12-8-rgb_front;97.65;102.45;This means that their work and services have been verified by Triple A.;8;13
18267;4K6kvm-NRYQ;4K6kvm-NRYQ-8-rgb_front;4K6kvm-NRYQ_13;4K6kvm-NRYQ_13-8-rgb_front;102.82;106.08;Once you've picked a mechanic they're several things you can look for when you go to the shop.;8;18
18268;4K6kvm-NRYQ;4K6kvm-NRYQ-8-rgb_front;4K6kvm-NRYQ_14;4K6kvm-NRYQ_14-8-rgb_front;106.67;115.45;First thing is, you can look for posted prices on the wall and the prices that you were quoted over the phone should be similar or be the same as those prices that are posted.;8;35
18269;4K6kvm-NRYQ;4K6kvm-NRYQ-8-rgb_front;4K6kvm-NRYQ_15;4K6kvm-NRYQ_15-8-rgb_front;116.14;122.71;Once you bring your car in, you should be able to have the mechanic look over your car and assess any repairs that need to be made.;8;27
18270;4K6kvm-NRYQ;4K6kvm-NRYQ-8-rgb_front;4K6kvm-NRYQ_16;4K6kvm-NRYQ_16-8-rgb_front;123.24;128.42;And before any work is actually done on the vehicle, you're entitled to approve that work.;8;16
18271;4K6kvm-NRYQ;4K6kvm-NRYQ-8-rgb_front;4K6kvm-NRYQ_17;4K6kvm-NRYQ_17-8-rgb_front;129.74;137.96;So if you know what repairs need to be made to your car, you can call around to dealers or other parts shops and find out how much that part should cost.;8;32
18272;4K6kvm-NRYQ;4K6kvm-NRYQ-8-rgb_front;4K6kvm-NRYQ_18;4K6kvm-NRYQ_18-8-rgb_front;138.79;147.84;The mechanic doing the service work on your car may charge a little bit more, but the price should be within the relative ball park of any other retailer.;8;29
18273;4K6kvm-NRYQ;4K6kvm-NRYQ-8-rgb_front;4K6kvm-NRYQ_19;4K6kvm-NRYQ_19-8-rgb_front;149.57;159.89;So if you believe that any of the work that a mechanic may recommend is not valid, you can always take your vehicle to another mechanic and ask for a second opinion.;8;32
18274;4K6kvm-NRYQ;4K6kvm-NRYQ-8-rgb_front;4K6kvm-NRYQ_2;4K6kvm-NRYQ_2-8-rgb_front;11.13;16.6;Hopefully if they have the same make and model of your car, they'll have a little insight into who can help you out.;8;23
18275;4K6kvm-NRYQ;4K6kvm-NRYQ-8-rgb_front;4K6kvm-NRYQ_20;4K6kvm-NRYQ_20-8-rgb_front;160.45;167.03;Before the work has begun, you should ask the mechanic how long the warranty is on both the parts and the labor.;8;22
18276;4K6kvm-NRYQ;4K6kvm-NRYQ-8-rgb_front;4K6kvm-NRYQ_21;4K6kvm-NRYQ_21-8-rgb_front;168.34;175.72;And also ask him to give a full explanation of the work with details of what exactly is wrong with your vehicle and what needs to be changed.;8;28
18277;4K6kvm-NRYQ;4K6kvm-NRYQ-8-rgb_front;4K6kvm-NRYQ_22;4K6kvm-NRYQ_22-8-rgb_front;176.01;181.4;So once you approve the work on your vehicle be sure to tell the mechanic to keep all the old parts.;8;21
18278;4K6kvm-NRYQ;4K6kvm-NRYQ-8-rgb_front;4K6kvm-NRYQ_23;4K6kvm-NRYQ_23-8-rgb_front;181.55;189.23;Because once the work is done, you want to take a look at the old part and verify that the part had actually been changed for a new one.;8;29
18279;4K6kvm-NRYQ;4K6kvm-NRYQ-8-rgb_front;4K6kvm-NRYQ_3_4;4K6kvm-NRYQ_3_4-8-rgb_front;17.55;43.04;Now the next thing that you can do is to look in your local phonebook. Now what you want to do is after you look up several car mechanics in your area, you want to give them a call and if you know what service you need with your vehicle, you can ask for a price quote or an approximate quote and compare several prices and you should be able to tell what the average price should be for a certain job.;8;82
18280;4K6kvm-NRYQ;4K6kvm-NRYQ-8-rgb_front;4K6kvm-NRYQ_5;4K6kvm-NRYQ_5-8-rgb_front;43.57;47.87;So you want to look for a mechanic that specializes in your particular make.;8;14
18281;4K6kvm-NRYQ;4K6kvm-NRYQ-8-rgb_front;4K6kvm-NRYQ_6;4K6kvm-NRYQ_6-8-rgb_front;47.92;53.34;Say if your car is made in Japan and is of a certain model that they specialize in that.;8;19
18282;4K6kvm-NRYQ;4K6kvm-NRYQ-8-rgb_front;4K6kvm-NRYQ_7;4K6kvm-NRYQ_7-8-rgb_front;53.85;59.29;Since they probably have more experience with that model of car, they'll probably do a better job.;8;17
18283;4K6kvm-NRYQ;4K6kvm-NRYQ-8-rgb_front;4K6kvm-NRYQ_8;4K6kvm-NRYQ_8-8-rgb_front;59.54;74.17;So another thing you can do when deciding which mechanic you should go to is you can go to the Better Business Bureaus' website and you can look up the name of the company and see if there's any complaints or how the customers' have rated that particular mechanic.;8;49
18284;4K6kvm-NRYQ;4K6kvm-NRYQ-8-rgb_front;4K6kvm-NRYQ_9;4K6kvm-NRYQ_9-8-rgb_front;74.47;83.41;Another thing you can look for when looking up a mechanic is you should be able to find out whether they have ASE certified mechanics.;8;25
18285;4K_FAmYAd2o;4K_FAmYAd2o-8-rgb_front;4K_FAmYAd2o_0;4K_FAmYAd2o_0-8-rgb_front;0.44;6.09;Before becoming a professional hairstylist, I had no idea there was even a difference between curling irons.;8;17
18286;4K_FAmYAd2o;4K_FAmYAd2o-8-rgb_front;4K_FAmYAd2o_1;4K_FAmYAd2o_1-8-rgb_front;6.42;10.87;I'm Laura Gibson, beauty expert here to tell you the different between curling irons.;8;14

18288;4K_FAmYAd2o;4K_FAmYAd2o-8-rgb_front;4K_FAmYAd2o_11;4K_FAmYAd2o_11-8-rgb_front;61.01;63.72;Chrome, gold and ceramic.;8;4

18291;4K_FAmYAd2o;4K_FAmYAd2o-8-rgb_front;4K_FAmYAd2o_2;4K_FAmYAd2o_2-8-rgb_front;11.48;12.8;There's three types.;8;3
18292;4K_FAmYAd2o;4K_FAmYAd2o-8-rgb_front;4K_FAmYAd2o_3;4K_FAmYAd2o_3-8-rgb_front;13.19;20.26;One would be your chrome curling iron, your gold curling iron and your ceramic curling iron.;8;16
18293;4K_FAmYAd2o;4K_FAmYAd2o-8-rgb_front;4K_FAmYAd2o_4;4K_FAmYAd2o_4-8-rgb_front;20.66;23.06;Now the different between the three, varies.;8;7
18294;4K_FAmYAd2o;4K_FAmYAd2o-8-rgb_front;4K_FAmYAd2o_5;4K_FAmYAd2o_5-8-rgb_front;23.3;31.28;For example, the first one which everyone usually likes to go because it will save you a penny, that would be your chrome.;8;23
18295;4K_FAmYAd2o;4K_FAmYAd2o-8-rgb_front;4K_FAmYAd2o_6;4K_FAmYAd2o_6-8-rgb_front;31.8;40.86;The second one is more for someone who uses their flat iron but not everyday, that would be your gold.;8;20
18296;4K_FAmYAd2o;4K_FAmYAd2o-8-rgb_front;4K_FAmYAd2o_7;4K_FAmYAd2o_7-8-rgb_front;41.42;48.83;Now however, if you're a curling iron junkie like me, you're going to want to what?;8;16
18297;4K_FAmYAd2o;4K_FAmYAd2o-8-rgb_front;4K_FAmYAd2o_8;4K_FAmYAd2o_8-8-rgb_front;48.83;51.84;You're going to want to go with ceramic.;8;8
18298;4K_FAmYAd2o;4K_FAmYAd2o-8-rgb_front;4K_FAmYAd2o_9;4K_FAmYAd2o_9-8-rgb_front;52.35;57.28;Ceramic actually seals your cuticle to leave you with that silky smooth finish.;8;13
18299;4K_f93M-BrA;4K_f93M-BrA-8-rgb_front;4K_f93M-BrA_0;4K_f93M-BrA_0-8-rgb_front;0.14;2.64;The next thing we're going to talk about is heating your blood python.;8;13

18301;4K_f93M-BrA;4K_f93M-BrA-8-rgb_front;4K_f93M-BrA_10;4K_f93M-BrA_10-8-rgb_front;47.14;51.41;Then we're going to be looking at, is you need two heat bulbs.;8;13
18302;4K_f93M-BrA;4K_f93M-BrA-8-rgb_front;4K_f93M-BrA_11;4K_f93M-BrA_11-8-rgb_front;51.66;53.16;You need a day bulb and a night bulb.;8;9
18303;4K_f93M-BrA;4K_f93M-BrA-8-rgb_front;4K_f93M-BrA_12;4K_f93M-BrA_12-8-rgb_front;53.65;70.16;Generally, your night bulb, which will be a red bulb or a blue bulb or a black bulb, colored so that the reptile doesn't see it at night so much and it allows them to sleep, is going to be a slightly lower wattage than say, your day bulb, which will be on during the day.;8;56
18304;4K_f93M-BrA;4K_f93M-BrA-8-rgb_front;4K_f93M-BrA_13;4K_f93M-BrA_13-8-rgb_front;71.79;75.94;Usually you want like a seventy five watt night bulb and a hundred watt day bulb, something like that.;8;19
18305;4K_f93M-BrA;4K_f93M-BrA-8-rgb_front;4K_f93M-BrA_14;4K_f93M-BrA_14-8-rgb_front;76.18;78.43;Every house is going to differ depending on the temperature you keep it in.;8;14

18307;4K_f93M-BrA;4K_f93M-BrA-8-rgb_front;4K_f93M-BrA_16;4K_f93M-BrA_16-8-rgb_front;82.17;91.63;What we're really looking for here is somewhere in the eighty five to ninety degree temperature range on the high end for your blood python and in the low end, somewhere around eighty five to eighty degrees.;8;37

18407;4QhpU9Fk5dA;4QhpU9Fk5dA-8-rgb_front;4QhpU9Fk5dA_2;4QhpU9Fk5dA_2-8-rgb_front;17.44;22.82;If you brew it at room temperature there should be very, very, very little caffeine in it.;8;17

18409;4QhpU9Fk5dA;4QhpU9Fk5dA-8-rgb_front;4QhpU9Fk5dA_4;4QhpU9Fk5dA_4-8-rgb_front;35.22;39.11;Another great thing about these flowering teas, is they last about a week.;8;13

18747;5GF2D_lAus4;5GF2D_lAus4-8-rgb_front;5GF2D_lAus4_21;5GF2D_lAus4_21-8-rgb_front;164.55;166.23;And, you can go from.;8;5

18749;5GF2D_lAus4;5GF2D_lAus4-8-rgb_front;5GF2D_lAus4_4;5GF2D_lAus4_4-8-rgb_front;21.71;29.17;Now, as far as number of fish, to go with, a good rule of thumb is one, one inch of fish per gallon.;8;23
18750;5GF2D_lAus4;5GF2D_lAus4-8-rgb_front;5GF2D_lAus4_5;5GF2D_lAus4_5-8-rgb_front;29.75;37.97;So, in other words, in a, in a, in a tank that's a ten gallon tank like this, about ten inches of fish.;8;23
18751;5GF2D_lAus4;5GF2D_lAus4-8-rgb_front;5GF2D_lAus4_6;5GF2D_lAus4_6-8-rgb_front;38.25;44.05;You can break that down, you know, ten one inch fish or, or five two inch fish.;8;17
18752;5GF2D_lAus4;5GF2D_lAus4-8-rgb_front;5GF2D_lAus4_7;5GF2D_lAus4_7-8-rgb_front;44.44;63.99;Now obviously if you get a ten inch fish, yeah he could live in here but, you get to a ten inch fish Oscar, something like that, you're going to want to go with a bigger tank, cause that's not going to be really fair to the fish to go with a ten inch fish in this, this, this small of a tank, wouldn't be fair to, to, the fish and you wouldn't enjoy it either.;8;76
18753;5GF2D_lAus4;5GF2D_lAus4-8-rgb_front;5GF2D_lAus4_8;5GF2D_lAus4_8-8-rgb_front;63.99;69.3;So, so that's what we're looking at here as far as fish.;8;12
18754;5GF2D_lAus4;5GF2D_lAus4-8-rgb_front;5GF2D_lAus4_9;5GF2D_lAus4_9-8-rgb_front;69.3;84.16;Obviously if you get a much bigger filter, you could probably fit more, more fish in there but for, for what we're doing here, basic, small, appropriate filter, bout, bout ten inches of fish in this tank.;8;37
18771;5HDlLzELoeg;5HDlLzELoeg-8-rgb_front;5HDlLzELoeg_1;5HDlLzELoeg_1-8-rgb_front;8.6;16.58;There are quite a few different ways to make a key but there are only a couple basically that locksmiths are usually commonly.;8;23

18774;5HDlLzELoeg;5HDlLzELoeg-8-rgb_front;5HDlLzELoeg_12;5HDlLzELoeg_12-8-rgb_front;76.7;79.6;Now this is a fully manual machine.;8;7

18847;5Oq-F-EC_pU;5Oq-F-EC_pU-8-rgb_front;5Oq-F-EC_pU_3;5Oq-F-EC_pU_3-8-rgb_front;34.08;52.43;Now I don't want to use a raw strobe on someone because it might be a little bit too harsh so that is when I'll use my umbrella and I can position my umbrella in a certain way that I can actually control my lighting a bit more than if I am just using a raw strobe or a diffuser so that is how that I like to use umbrellas.;8;70
18848;5Oq-F-EC_pU;5Oq-F-EC_pU-8-rgb_front;5Oq-F-EC_pU_4;5Oq-F-EC_pU_4-8-rgb_front;52.75;56.19;There are different sized ones, there are big ones, there are also different prices.;8;14

18857;5Pm9nRXM-L0;5Pm9nRXM-L0-8-rgb_front;5Pm9nRXM-L0_11;5Pm9nRXM-L0_11-8-rgb_front;60.67;63.96;I have to listen for him, I have to smell him, I have to look for him.;8;17

18859;5Pm9nRXM-L0;5Pm9nRXM-L0-8-rgb_front;5Pm9nRXM-L0_13;5Pm9nRXM-L0_13-8-rgb_front;71.63;81.79;As the dog progresses in this, then you take it out for real, and you go out into the woods, and you have people hide, and you give the dog the scent of that person and encourage the dog to find them.;8;42
18860;5Pm9nRXM-L0;5Pm9nRXM-L0-8-rgb_front;5Pm9nRXM-L0_14;5Pm9nRXM-L0_14-8-rgb_front;82.11;91.88;When the dog finds that person, you've already set that person up with maybe some treats, or maybe a ball if the dog really enjoys the ball, or some other reward that's very motivating for that dog.;8;37
18861;5Pm9nRXM-L0;5Pm9nRXM-L0-8-rgb_front;5Pm9nRXM-L0_15;5Pm9nRXM-L0_15-8-rgb_front;92.33;101.31;Over time, the dog will start to understand the scent of this person mixed with me going out and finding him ends up with a fun game and a fun reward.;8;31
18862;5Pm9nRXM-L0;5Pm9nRXM-L0-8-rgb_front;5Pm9nRXM-L0_16;5Pm9nRXM-L0_16-8-rgb_front;101.71;104.16;And so that's how you train a dog, a rescue dog.;8;11
18863;5Pm9nRXM-L0;5Pm9nRXM-L0-8-rgb_front;5Pm9nRXM-L0_2;5Pm9nRXM-L0_2-8-rgb_front;8.17;11.58;The topic of today's discussion is teaching you how to train for a rescue dog.;8;15

18865;5Pm9nRXM-L0;5Pm9nRXM-L0-8-rgb_front;5Pm9nRXM-L0_4;5Pm9nRXM-L0_4-8-rgb_front;15.83;20.95;People get lost all the time out in the woods or out in the open, and can't find their way back.;8;21

18867;5Pm9nRXM-L0;5Pm9nRXM-L0-8-rgb_front;5Pm9nRXM-L0_6;5Pm9nRXM-L0_6-8-rgb_front;30.77;34.47;Now, you can actually start training a rescue dog from a very young age.;8;14

18881;5S5lUNRT85M;5S5lUNRT85M-8-rgb_front;5S5lUNRT85M_0;5S5lUNRT85M_0-8-rgb_front;0.92;7.71;In this clip, we're going to go over basic kite maintenance and, you know, how to take care of your kite, make sure that it's in proper working order at all times.;8;32
18882;5S5lUNRT85M;5S5lUNRT85M-8-rgb_front;5S5lUNRT85M_1;5S5lUNRT85M_1-8-rgb_front;8.23;15.88;One thing that can happen now with these new found or these new age kites, you know, there's a lot of advancements that make things a lot more user-friendly, a lot more forgiving.;8;33
18883;5S5lUNRT85M;5S5lUNRT85M-8-rgb_front;5S5lUNRT85M_10;5S5lUNRT85M_10-8-rgb_front;72.22;76.81;Different companies use specific styles for, you know, their inflation systems.;8;11
18884;5S5lUNRT85M;5S5lUNRT85M-8-rgb_front;5S5lUNRT85M_11;5S5lUNRT85M_11-8-rgb_front;77.16;79.49;The new age kites are all one pump systems.;8;9
18885;5S5lUNRT85M;5S5lUNRT85M-8-rgb_front;5S5lUNRT85M_12;5S5lUNRT85M_12-8-rgb_front;79.49;88.72;So, if you can get a kite where you're going to put it on and inflate it all from a single point, it will inflate all these struts, including your leading edge all from right here.;8;36
18886;5S5lUNRT85M;5S5lUNRT85M-8-rgb_front;5S5lUNRT85M_13;5S5lUNRT85M_13-8-rgb_front;89.1;95.17;Other kites are, you know, new wholesale kites are going to have separate, you know, inflation points for each one here.;8;21
18887;5S5lUNRT85M;5S5lUNRT85M-8-rgb_front;5S5lUNRT85M_14;5S5lUNRT85M_14-8-rgb_front;95.32;106.93;And, you know, that can be cool because you're making sure that you isolate air from every compartment, but it's definitely going to add a couple of extra seconds on to your, you know, sort of start-up time when you're trying to get into it.;8;45
18888;5S5lUNRT85M;5S5lUNRT85M-8-rgb_front;5S5lUNRT85M_15;5S5lUNRT85M_15-8-rgb_front;106.93;114.55;So, if you don't have very much time, you just like, you know you're taking a lunch break and you want to get out and have a session, a newer kite with a one pump system is going to help you out.;8;42
18889;5S5lUNRT85M;5S5lUNRT85M-8-rgb_front;5S5lUNRT85M_2;5S5lUNRT85M_2-8-rgb_front;16.35;19.19;Things like bridles which are attached to the leading edge right here.;8;12
18890;5S5lUNRT85M;5S5lUNRT85M-8-rgb_front;5S5lUNRT85M_3;5S5lUNRT85M_3-8-rgb_front;19.19;34.06;You know, they're really good, they help with re-launchabiity, they give you a much larger wind range but, at the same time, it's one extra thing if it goes wrong and breaks on you, it can send you into what's called a like a death loop, where your kite just looping, looping, looping and taking you for a ride.;8;59
18891;5S5lUNRT85M;5S5lUNRT85M-8-rgb_front;5S5lUNRT85M_4;5S5lUNRT85M_4-8-rgb_front;34.06;39.51;So making sure these things are in proper working order at all times is definitely going to help you in the long run.;8;23
18892;5S5lUNRT85M;5S5lUNRT85M-8-rgb_front;5S5lUNRT85M_5;5S5lUNRT85M_5-8-rgb_front;39.56;45.68;So pretty much every time you go in and out for a session, you want to check your kite and go over everything.;8;23
18893;5S5lUNRT85M;5S5lUNRT85M-8-rgb_front;5S5lUNRT85M_6;5S5lUNRT85M_6-8-rgb_front;45.92;51.34;This is a bow-style kite from Cabrinha, it's a light wind specific kite so you know it's a larger meterage kite.;8;21
18894;5S5lUNRT85M;5S5lUNRT85M-8-rgb_front;5S5lUNRT85M_7;5S5lUNRT85M_7-8-rgb_front;51.39;56.5;Inside here, there's actually bladders that are basically going to hold all the air for you.;8;16
18895;5S5lUNRT85M;5S5lUNRT85M-8-rgb_front;5S5lUNRT85M_8;5S5lUNRT85M_8-8-rgb_front;56.87;67.04;These bladders can, you know, pretty much get pinholes any sort of tear any sort of rupture, the glue can come apart and can give you a pretty tough time trying to get them back together.;8;36
18896;5S5lUNRT85M;5S5lUNRT85M-8-rgb_front;5S5lUNRT85M_9;5S5lUNRT85M_9-8-rgb_front;67.07;71.5;So, you know the more you maintain your kite, the more you upkeep it, the happier you're going to be.;8;20

18985;5Uy3r6Sl4pM;5Uy3r6Sl4pM-8-rgb_front;5Uy3r6Sl4pM_7;5Uy3r6Sl4pM_7-8-rgb_front;62.63;65.56;That's the ideal method of making an amicable divorce.;8;9
18986;5Uy3r6Sl4pM;5Uy3r6Sl4pM-8-rgb_front;5Uy3r6Sl4pM_8;5Uy3r6Sl4pM_8-8-rgb_front;66.18;69.47;If you can do that and communicate like that, you're ahead of many couples.;8;14
18987;5Uy3r6Sl4pM;5Uy3r6Sl4pM-8-rgb_front;5Uy3r6Sl4pM_9;5Uy3r6Sl4pM_9-8-rgb_front;69.56;73.63;I do wish you good luck, Dr. Felicia signing off.;8;10
19001;5VkXcJblh4o;5VkXcJblh4o-8-rgb_front;5VkXcJblh4o_1;5VkXcJblh4o_1-8-rgb_front;2.73;8.5;Step two, what we're going to do here is pick the right quality of paper for our drawing.;8;18
19002;5VkXcJblh4o;5VkXcJblh4o-8-rgb_front;5VkXcJblh4o_10;5VkXcJblh4o_10-8-rgb_front;55.12;59.37;So I found that this is the best paper to use for the thing I'm going to be using today.;8;20
19003;5VkXcJblh4o;5VkXcJblh4o-8-rgb_front;5VkXcJblh4o_2;5VkXcJblh4o_2-8-rgb_front;8.63;11.01;Now there's a lot of different paper you can use.;8;10
19004;5VkXcJblh4o;5VkXcJblh4o-8-rgb_front;5VkXcJblh4o_3;5VkXcJblh4o_3-8-rgb_front;11.04;14.41;I've drawn thousands of drawings on napkins.;8;7
19005;5VkXcJblh4o;5VkXcJblh4o-8-rgb_front;5VkXcJblh4o_4;5VkXcJblh4o_4-8-rgb_front;14.82;18.3;You can on any kind of paper that will hold ink, you can use.;8;14
19006;5VkXcJblh4o;5VkXcJblh4o-8-rgb_front;5VkXcJblh4o_5;5VkXcJblh4o_5-8-rgb_front;18.72;31.78;But I found the best paper for my drawings is just plain old--paper I use for my computer to print out with--your plain white sheet of paper, and I've had more results with that.;8;34
19007;5VkXcJblh4o;5VkXcJblh4o-8-rgb_front;5VkXcJblh4o_6;5VkXcJblh4o_6-8-rgb_front;31.78;38.08;Now, onion-skin paper holds ink really well, but it doesn't work great for coloring on paper.;8;16
19008;5VkXcJblh4o;5VkXcJblh4o-8-rgb_front;5VkXcJblh4o_7;5VkXcJblh4o_7-8-rgb_front;38.08;40.96;So this here holds colored ink really well.;8;8
19009;5VkXcJblh4o;5VkXcJblh4o-8-rgb_front;5VkXcJblh4o_8;5VkXcJblh4o_8-8-rgb_front;40.96;49.25;Also I have colored pencils I use, but I find that the ink works better with the pencils than the pencils on paper.;8;23
19010;5VkXcJblh4o;5VkXcJblh4o-8-rgb_front;5VkXcJblh4o_9;5VkXcJblh4o_9-8-rgb_front;49.25;55.08;Because you always have to keep sharpening your pencils, and then they break and it smears off and it makes it hard.;8;22
19011;5VseAeFbfgI;5VseAeFbfgI-8-rgb_front;5VseAeFbfgI_0;5VseAeFbfgI_0-8-rgb_front;0.49;0.63;Hi.;8;1

19013;5VseAeFbfgI;5VseAeFbfgI-8-rgb_front;5VseAeFbfgI_11;5VseAeFbfgI_11-8-rgb_front;40.8;42.5;So you just run your chalk like that.;8;8
19014;5VseAeFbfgI;5VseAeFbfgI-8-rgb_front;5VseAeFbfgI_12;5VseAeFbfgI_12-8-rgb_front;42.67;47.87;It's a chalk that's got a little, you can hardly see it but it's a little tracing wheel.;8;18
19015;5VseAeFbfgI;5VseAeFbfgI-8-rgb_front;5VseAeFbfgI_13;5VseAeFbfgI_13-8-rgb_front;48.27;52.59;And I'll come down another inch and a half and we'll trace again.;8;13
19016;5VseAeFbfgI;5VseAeFbfgI-8-rgb_front;5VseAeFbfgI_14;5VseAeFbfgI_14-8-rgb_front;53.85;59.26;You will sew on those chalk lines and then you can just rub and the chalk will come off.;8;19
19017;5VseAeFbfgI;5VseAeFbfgI-8-rgb_front;5VseAeFbfgI_15;5VseAeFbfgI_15-8-rgb_front;59.69;62.11;This is what you'd use on dark fabric.;8;8
19018;5VseAeFbfgI;5VseAeFbfgI-8-rgb_front;5VseAeFbfgI_16;5VseAeFbfgI_16-8-rgb_front;63.6;73.83;On this fabric I am going to use the blue side and I'm just going to start in the center here and I'm just going to draw a blue line.;8;30
19019;5VseAeFbfgI;5VseAeFbfgI-8-rgb_front;5VseAeFbfgI_17;5VseAeFbfgI_17-8-rgb_front;74.37;76.93;It's going to scare you at first because you're going to see this blue.;8;14
19020;5VseAeFbfgI;5VseAeFbfgI-8-rgb_front;5VseAeFbfgI_18;5VseAeFbfgI_18-8-rgb_front;77.61;82.31;And then I'm going to move over and I'm going to mark this one every two inches.;8;17
19021;5VseAeFbfgI;5VseAeFbfgI-8-rgb_front;5VseAeFbfgI_19;5VseAeFbfgI_19-8-rgb_front;83.59;85.61;And I just keep marking it.;8;6
19022;5VseAeFbfgI;5VseAeFbfgI-8-rgb_front;5VseAeFbfgI_2;5VseAeFbfgI_2-8-rgb_front;7.26;11.83;If you want to do lines there's two ways to mark them.;8;12
19023;5VseAeFbfgI;5VseAeFbfgI-8-rgb_front;5VseAeFbfgI_20;5VseAeFbfgI_20-8-rgb_front;88.36;95.66;And when I'm done with sewing these channels all I have to do is spray it with water and it will just disappear.;8;23
19024;5VseAeFbfgI;5VseAeFbfgI-8-rgb_front;5VseAeFbfgI_21;5VseAeFbfgI_21-8-rgb_front;95.92;97.22;It's called mark be gone.;8;5
19025;5VseAeFbfgI;5VseAeFbfgI-8-rgb_front;5VseAeFbfgI_22;5VseAeFbfgI_22-8-rgb_front;97.91;108.93;I could use the purple side which will show up a little bit more and by morning that purple mark will have just disappeared.;8;24
19026;5VseAeFbfgI;5VseAeFbfgI-8-rgb_front;5VseAeFbfgI_23;5VseAeFbfgI_23-8-rgb_front;109.24;110.43;So that's two ways.;8;4
19027;5VseAeFbfgI;5VseAeFbfgI-8-rgb_front;5VseAeFbfgI_24;5VseAeFbfgI_24-8-rgb_front;110.92;118.54;You can even take your marks and go across this way two inches and then when you quilt you'll be showing a square.;8;23
19028;5VseAeFbfgI;5VseAeFbfgI-8-rgb_front;5VseAeFbfgI_25;5VseAeFbfgI_25-8-rgb_front;118.95;121.28;So there's so many different ways you can quilt.;8;9
19029;5VseAeFbfgI;5VseAeFbfgI-8-rgb_front;5VseAeFbfgI_26;5VseAeFbfgI_26-8-rgb_front;121.28;123.33;And then you can call yourself a quilter.;8;8
19030;5VseAeFbfgI;5VseAeFbfgI-8-rgb_front;5VseAeFbfgI_3;5VseAeFbfgI_3-8-rgb_front;11.83;15.99;You can do them with chalk or with a quilt marker.;8;11
19031;5VseAeFbfgI;5VseAeFbfgI-8-rgb_front;5VseAeFbfgI_4;5VseAeFbfgI_4-8-rgb_front;16.69;24.03;If you use the blue side it will stay on until you sprits it with water and then it will disappear.;8;21
19032;5VseAeFbfgI;5VseAeFbfgI-8-rgb_front;5VseAeFbfgI_5;5VseAeFbfgI_5-8-rgb_front;24.33;26.37;So it's a great marking tool for you.;8;8
19033;5VseAeFbfgI;5VseAeFbfgI-8-rgb_front;5VseAeFbfgI_6;5VseAeFbfgI_6-8-rgb_front;27.54;29.35;Now if we were using chalk?;8;6
19034;5VseAeFbfgI;5VseAeFbfgI-8-rgb_front;5VseAeFbfgI_7;5VseAeFbfgI_7-8-rgb_front;29.72;30.81;That's when I would use it.;8;6
19035;5VseAeFbfgI;5VseAeFbfgI-8-rgb_front;5VseAeFbfgI_8;5VseAeFbfgI_8-8-rgb_front;30.81;31.69;On this black.;8;3
19036;5VseAeFbfgI;5VseAeFbfgI-8-rgb_front;5VseAeFbfgI_9;5VseAeFbfgI_9-8-rgb_front;31.98;33.5;Because I could not see.;8;5
19037;5XSD1NAFaxA;5XSD1NAFaxA-8-rgb_front;5XSD1NAFaxA_1;5XSD1NAFaxA_1-8-rgb_front;2.63;7.94;Today we're going to be learning how to play Portal, a game by Valve Software, a company with which I have no affiliation.;8;23

19040;5XSD1NAFaxA;5XSD1NAFaxA-8-rgb_front;5XSD1NAFaxA_12;5XSD1NAFaxA_12-8-rgb_front;69.84;70.65;Let?s see if that works.;8;5
19041;5XSD1NAFaxA;5XSD1NAFaxA-8-rgb_front;5XSD1NAFaxA_2;5XSD1NAFaxA_2-8-rgb_front;9.66;13.06;All right here we are going into test chamber 10.;8;10

19043;5XSD1NAFaxA;5XSD1NAFaxA-8-rgb_front;5XSD1NAFaxA_4;5XSD1NAFaxA_4-8-rgb_front;16.84;23.3;The voice that's talking to me is having some glitches right now.;8;12

19045;5XSD1NAFaxA;5XSD1NAFaxA-8-rgb_front;5XSD1NAFaxA_6;5XSD1NAFaxA_6-8-rgb_front;35.42;40.6;So, here's our orange exit portal and here are the stairs.;8;11
19046;5XSD1NAFaxA;5XSD1NAFaxA-8-rgb_front;5XSD1NAFaxA_7;5XSD1NAFaxA_7-8-rgb_front;41.5;44.98;We can't jump up there, we can't jump high enough.;8;10

19078;5Z8xrAeHsNM;5Z8xrAeHsNM-8-rgb_front;5Z8xrAeHsNM_2;5Z8xrAeHsNM_2-8-rgb_front;16.8;20.75;If she slips this boat there is now way she is going to get trapped in the boat.;8;18

19202;5fcxgweEABo;5fcxgweEABo-8-rgb_front;5fcxgweEABo_2;5fcxgweEABo_2-8-rgb_front;17.75;27.1;Now the cool thing about this is this appears to be a completely normal deck of cards but there is some sneaky stuff about it that I'm going to tell you about in a little while.;8;36
19203;5fcxgweEABo;5fcxgweEABo-8-rgb_front;5fcxgweEABo_3;5fcxgweEABo_3-8-rgb_front;27.1;32.41;You can do all kinds of tricks, you can do some variations of tricks that I've taught you in other segments.;8;21
19204;5fcxgweEABo;5fcxgweEABo-8-rgb_front;5fcxgweEABo_4;5fcxgweEABo_4-8-rgb_front;33.54;42.07;They can be shuffled and cut and everything and handled like normal cards, so even though they appear to be completely normal they're not.;8;24
19205;5fcxgweEABo;5fcxgweEABo-8-rgb_front;5fcxgweEABo_5;5fcxgweEABo_5-8-rgb_front;42.71;50.04;And in the next few videos I'll be teaching you all kinds of cool ways to use this to do all kinds of entertaining tricks.;8;25
19206;5fcxgweEABo;5fcxgweEABo-8-rgb_front;5fcxgweEABo_6;5fcxgweEABo_6-8-rgb_front;50.13;52.63;So stick around and we'll talk about the stripper deck.;8;10
19236;5k66qfWaM7E;5k66qfWaM7E-8-rgb_front;5k66qfWaM7E_0;5k66qfWaM7E_0-8-rgb_front;0.07;2.68;Now let's start combining the strips of our image.;8;9
19237;5k66qfWaM7E;5k66qfWaM7E-8-rgb_front;5k66qfWaM7E_1;5k66qfWaM7E_1-8-rgb_front;3.18;23.65;What we want to do, is we want to take one strip and then make some room to put the first strip of the second image, and then take the strip of the first image, put it next to that, and keep alternating as you go along, and it's going to be one long picture with alternating strips from each image.;8;61
19238;5k66qfWaM7E;5k66qfWaM7E-8-rgb_front;5k66qfWaM7E_10;5k66qfWaM7E_10-8-rgb_front;121.39;134.99;So, so far in this step I've shown you how to take your images and place them, interchange them, each strip from one image to the next, to make a long mixed image that is going to be folded up.;8;40
19239;5k66qfWaM7E;5k66qfWaM7E-8-rgb_front;5k66qfWaM7E_2;5k66qfWaM7E_2-8-rgb_front;26.42;29.13;The important thing over here is just to keep everything in order.;8;12
19240;5k66qfWaM7E;5k66qfWaM7E-8-rgb_front;5k66qfWaM7E_3;5k66qfWaM7E_3-8-rgb_front;29.13;57.06;Make sure that you're putting the strips one after the other in the right consecutive order, otherwise it gets a little--the finished product won't work, and it gets a little confusing if you--if you don't take note as you're putting in the images.;8;43
19241;5k66qfWaM7E;5k66qfWaM7E-8-rgb_front;5k66qfWaM7E_4;5k66qfWaM7E_4-8-rgb_front;57.06;71.02;One of the signs that you should look for when completing the interchanging of the strips, is that you've started with one image, the first image, and you've actually ended with the last piece being from the second image.;8;39
19242;5k66qfWaM7E;5k66qfWaM7E-8-rgb_front;5k66qfWaM7E_5;5k66qfWaM7E_5-8-rgb_front;71.02;76.15;And that's one indication to know that you actually combined the image properly.;8;13
19243;5k66qfWaM7E;5k66qfWaM7E-8-rgb_front;5k66qfWaM7E_6;5k66qfWaM7E_6-8-rgb_front;76.15;94.94;Also it's important to maybe when you create the image, images, knowing that you're going to have to interchange them like this, to make them very distinct colors or possibly a different, a different type of shape or image entirely, so that this part of the project doesn't get too confusing.;8;51
19244;5k66qfWaM7E;5k66qfWaM7E-8-rgb_front;5k66qfWaM7E_7;5k66qfWaM7E_7-8-rgb_front;94.94;101.77;But we see that we've combined all the images, all the different shapes, and now we're going to put these together.;8;21
19245;5k66qfWaM7E;5k66qfWaM7E-8-rgb_front;5k66qfWaM7E_8;5k66qfWaM7E_8-8-rgb_front;101.77;119.88;We're going to carefully flip it over and put tape so that all of these strips stick together, and then it's going to be folded up like an accordion shape, and once it's folded up it will become half its size, and then we'll be able to put it directly on a piece of regular white paper, the same size as the original image.;8;64
19246;5k66qfWaM7E;5k66qfWaM7E-8-rgb_front;5k66qfWaM7E_9;5k66qfWaM7E_9-8-rgb_front;119.88;121.35;So that's what we're going to do next.;8;8

19263;5myLxfF9NWM;5myLxfF9NWM-8-rgb_front;5myLxfF9NWM_2;5myLxfF9NWM_2-8-rgb_front;8.68;10.24;Sallow skin is dull skin.;8;5

As I mentioned before you want to do this no more than twice a week so definitely with sallow skin they do have built up dead skin cells on the surface and they have not been properly treating their skin.;8;54
19266;5myLxfF9NWM;5myLxfF9NWM-8-rgb_front;5myLxfF9NWM_6;5myLxfF9NWM_6-8-rgb_front;35.25;61.5;They might have thought they were treating their skin with proper products but if you have dead skin cells built up on the surface and they are not slothing off or you are not exfoliating properly, nothing is going to come in or nothing if going to come out and basically it is like having a barrier over the top of your skin and you put something on top of a barrier like a piece of wood for instance and it is not going to be absorbed in and it is not going to go out it is just going to sit there.;8;103
19267;5myLxfF9NWM;5myLxfF9NWM-8-rgb_front;5myLxfF9NWM_7;5myLxfF9NWM_7-8-rgb_front;61.9;76.74;With sallow skin in order for you to achieve that healthy skin glowing look you want to definitely exfoliate, use your papaya and enzyme treatments bi-weekly and properly treat your skin so your products will work as well.;8;38

19271;5newWSXJB1I;5newWSXJB1I-8-rgb_front;5newWSXJB1I_3;5newWSXJB1I_3-8-rgb_front;26.86;28.68;That's what makes it an effective pitch.;8;7

19274;5nk3hS9UHl0;5nk3hS9UHl0-8-rgb_front;5nk3hS9UHl0_1;5nk3hS9UHl0_1-8-rgb_front;3.77;12.0;But the first and foremost is to get that bird isolated, away from all your other birds as fast as possible.;8;21
19275;5nk3hS9UHl0;5nk3hS9UHl0-8-rgb_front;5nk3hS9UHl0_10;5nk3hS9UHl0_10-8-rgb_front;70.68;73.59;Say, from moving it from one location to another.;8;9
19276;5nk3hS9UHl0;5nk3hS9UHl0-8-rgb_front;5nk3hS9UHl0_11;5nk3hS9UHl0_11-8-rgb_front;75.04;78.49;Marvel Aid works real well for minor things.;8;8

19278;5nk3hS9UHl0;5nk3hS9UHl0-8-rgb_front;5nk3hS9UHl0_13;5nk3hS9UHl0_13-8-rgb_front;87.55;91.78;And more than likely, that will be the only way you'll be able to save that bird.;8;17
19279;5nk3hS9UHl0;5nk3hS9UHl0-8-rgb_front;5nk3hS9UHl0_14;5nk3hS9UHl0_14-8-rgb_front;92.26;104.19;If your bird has been exposed to smoke, near a fire or anywhere where the smoke has got to the bird, birds cannot get that smoke out of their lungs.;8;30
19280;5nk3hS9UHl0;5nk3hS9UHl0-8-rgb_front;5nk3hS9UHl0_15;5nk3hS9UHl0_15-8-rgb_front;104.9;112.39;They may go on for months and never show a sign, and then all of the sudden, you loose that bird.;8;21
19281;5nk3hS9UHl0;5nk3hS9UHl0-8-rgb_front;5nk3hS9UHl0_16;5nk3hS9UHl0_16-8-rgb_front;113.23;129.63;Fires are very dangerous to birds, and, I myself even had a fire in which I thought my birds were fine, and then months later I started loosing them, and it was said that it was due to the smoke in their lung.;8;43
19282;5nk3hS9UHl0;5nk3hS9UHl0-8-rgb_front;5nk3hS9UHl0_2;5nk3hS9UHl0_2-8-rgb_front;12.92;14.58;Then the bird needs warmth.;8;5
19283;5nk3hS9UHl0;5nk3hS9UHl0-8-rgb_front;5nk3hS9UHl0_3;5nk3hS9UHl0_3-8-rgb_front;15.6;22.09;Use a heating pad, a brooder, anything that you can to get warmth to that bird.;8;16
19284;5nk3hS9UHl0;5nk3hS9UHl0-8-rgb_front;5nk3hS9UHl0_4;5nk3hS9UHl0_4-8-rgb_front;23.88;31.42;I would suggest highly that when you know a bird is sick, that you see a, an avian vet.;8;19
19285;5nk3hS9UHl0;5nk3hS9UHl0-8-rgb_front;5nk3hS9UHl0_5;5nk3hS9UHl0_5-8-rgb_front;32.14;35.86;They're not a lot of avian vets around, but there are many good ones around.;8;15

19287;5nk3hS9UHl0;5nk3hS9UHl0-8-rgb_front;5nk3hS9UHl0_7;5nk3hS9UHl0_7-8-rgb_front;46.96;58.28;Because, they are attuned to hiding any illness away from their flock so that they won't be banned from the flock.;8;21

19289;5nk3hS9UHl0;5nk3hS9UHl0-8-rgb_front;5nk3hS9UHl0_9;5nk3hS9UHl0_9-8-rgb_front;65.95;70.02;I use Marvel Aid if a bird is just being stressed.;8;11

19313;5pvdT18f92A;5pvdT18f92A-8-rgb_front;5pvdT18f92A_2;5pvdT18f92A_2-8-rgb_front;12.26;30.04;And the first is after you have the pitcher like this and the steam wand is in the milk and after you turn on the steam wand and start steaming, the first process that you are going to do is kind of hold it.;8;44
19314;5pvdT18f92A;5pvdT18f92A-8-rgb_front;5pvdT18f92A_3;5pvdT18f92A_3-8-rgb_front;30.04;42.11;I would like to hold the pitcher in this groove here and hold it at an angle and get the milk rolling, so it is kind of spinning inside the pitcher while the tip of the steam wand is submerged in the milk.;8;43
19315;5pvdT18f92A;5pvdT18f92A-8-rgb_front;5pvdT18f92A_4;5pvdT18f92A_4-8-rgb_front;44.09;64.18;Right when you can feel the milk break into the same temperature as your hand, which is about a hundred degrees, right when you can feel it warm up you will drop it down to start stretching or introducing air and that is where you are making the foam in the milk and that is what you are going to do.;8;61
19316;5pvdT18f92A;5pvdT18f92A-8-rgb_front;5pvdT18f92A_5;5pvdT18f92A_5-8-rgb_front;64.18;70.63;You are not going to have to do as much for a lighter, like, a skim milk or something like that.;8;21

19318;5pvdT18f92A;5pvdT18f92A-8-rgb_front;5pvdT18f92A_7;5pvdT18f92A_7-8-rgb_front;76.61;93.44;And then the third process is you push the pitcher back up, submerge the steam wand once again and then get it spinning again, and that is going to blend your foam with your steam milk and kind of get a nice consistency throughout the milk.;8;46
19319;5pvdT18f92A;5pvdT18f92A-8-rgb_front;5pvdT18f92A_8;5pvdT18f92A_8-8-rgb_front;93.97;95.69;So I will demonstrate that.;8;5

19322;5q5q5d8vP24;5q5q5d8vP24-8-rgb_front;5q5q5d8vP24_10;5q5q5d8vP24_10-8-rgb_front;74.05;81.16;Obviously, if a carpenter had a chance to hit in a nail, would he rather go like this, or like this?;8;21

19326;5q5q5d8vP24;5q5q5d8vP24-8-rgb_front;5q5q5d8vP24_2;5q5q5d8vP24_2-8-rgb_front;21.31;31.24;For example, you're a certain distance, 140 yards, 150 yards, and you don't know if you should swing hard at an 8 iron or easy with a 7 iron.;8;29
19327;5q5q5d8vP24;5q5q5d8vP24-8-rgb_front;5q5q5d8vP24_3;5q5q5d8vP24_3-8-rgb_front;31.69;37.89;The hammer swing, and you probably know the answer already, makes this very clear and easier to do.;8;18
19328;5q5q5d8vP24;5q5q5d8vP24-8-rgb_front;5q5q5d8vP24_4;5q5q5d8vP24_4-8-rgb_front;38.39;47.89;Because, we know that it's more difficult to hit a nail straight in with a bigger, harder swing than it is with a shorter, easier swing.;8;26
19329;5q5q5d8vP24;5q5q5d8vP24-8-rgb_front;5q5q5d8vP24_5;5q5q5d8vP24_5-8-rgb_front;48.74;54.57;So, if you're between clubs, let's say you're not sure if it's an 8 iron or a 7 iron.;8;19

19635;BJZFpsaYwgI;BJZFpsaYwgI-8-rgb_front;BJZFpsaYwgI_1;BJZFpsaYwgI_1-8-rgb_front;3.41;7.06;The key element of this track is that it is a dirt track, and not a pavement track.;8;18

19638;BJZFpsaYwgI;BJZFpsaYwgI-8-rgb_front;BJZFpsaYwgI_12;BJZFpsaYwgI_12-8-rgb_front;74.68;78.01;Those are very big safety things.;8;6
19639;BJZFpsaYwgI;BJZFpsaYwgI-8-rgb_front;BJZFpsaYwgI_2;BJZFpsaYwgI_2-8-rgb_front;7.55;13.55;So they constantly are watering the track to keep, to try to keep the track in race condition.;8;18
19640;BJZFpsaYwgI;BJZFpsaYwgI-8-rgb_front;BJZFpsaYwgI_3;BJZFpsaYwgI_3-8-rgb_front;13.58;19.72;The inside of the track, where the berm is, it's not really built up right now, but there is a berm up there.;8;23
19641;BJZFpsaYwgI;BJZFpsaYwgI-8-rgb_front;BJZFpsaYwgI_4;BJZFpsaYwgI_4-8-rgb_front;19.72;22.26;You want to stay between the boundaries of the berm and the wall.;8;13

19643;BJZFpsaYwgI;BJZFpsaYwgI-8-rgb_front;BJZFpsaYwgI_6;BJZFpsaYwgI_6-8-rgb_front;29.84;38.23;You know, if you start flipping and you don't want to go into the stands, because you can injure people in the stands it also keeps you inside the track, so you are not going to injury yourself by flipping over and hitting something outside the track.;8;47
19644;BJZFpsaYwgI;BJZFpsaYwgI-8-rgb_front;BJZFpsaYwgI_7;BJZFpsaYwgI_7-8-rgb_front;38.23;42.59;The flagman stands in that stand right over there.;8;9
19645;BJZFpsaYwgI;BJZFpsaYwgI-8-rgb_front;BJZFpsaYwgI_8;BJZFpsaYwgI_8-8-rgb_front;43.58;47.38;And this is corner one, two, three and four.;8;9
19646;BJZFpsaYwgI;BJZFpsaYwgI-8-rgb_front;BJZFpsaYwgI_9;BJZFpsaYwgI_9-8-rgb_front;48.23;53.99;Coming out of corner four, that's where the start line is for the re-start and the original start.;8;18

19648;BJebuYFoRis;BJebuYFoRis-8-rgb_front;BJebuYFoRis_1;BJebuYFoRis_1-8-rgb_front;8.71;15.9;So, you want to buy something that can withstand the heat without worrying about pouring warm water in there, prepare the teapot.;8;22
19649;BJebuYFoRis;BJebuYFoRis-8-rgb_front;BJebuYFoRis_10;BJebuYFoRis_10-8-rgb_front;55.0;56.28;And then, you put your hot water in.;8;8

19658;BJebuYFoRis;BJebuYFoRis-8-rgb_front;BJebuYFoRis_19;BJebuYFoRis_19-8-rgb_front;96.0;99.3;And, this will be a wonderful display when you have guests over.;8;12

19664;BJebuYFoRis;BJebuYFoRis-8-rgb_front;BJebuYFoRis_4;BJebuYFoRis_4-8-rgb_front;20.29;23.41;You can put it in boiling water and then put it in the freezer and it will not break.;8;19
19665;BJebuYFoRis;BJebuYFoRis-8-rgb_front;BJebuYFoRis_5;BJebuYFoRis_5-8-rgb_front;23.95;31.85;It is also handmade, where the spout, when you pour the tea, it is a drip-less spout.;8;17

19667;BJebuYFoRis;BJebuYFoRis-8-rgb_front;BJebuYFoRis_7;BJebuYFoRis_7-8-rgb_front;35.34;44.4;This is the best type of teapot if you are trying to brew a white tea or a very nice green tea, and you like to see the color of the brew and you like to see the leaves dance.;8;40
19668;BJebuYFoRis;BJebuYFoRis-8-rgb_front;BJebuYFoRis_8;BJebuYFoRis_8-8-rgb_front;45.13;49.33;This is the filter that you put in, and you would put your tea leaves in here as such.;8;19

19673;BKHAvX9rFw0;BKHAvX9rFw0-8-rgb_front;BKHAvX9rFw0_11;BKHAvX9rFw0_11-8-rgb_front;77.21;79.41;Obviously, you want to be able to do it on both sides.;8;12

19681;BKHAvX9rFw0;BKHAvX9rFw0-8-rgb_front;BKHAvX9rFw0_7;BKHAvX9rFw0_7-8-rgb_front;42.46;53.45;Also, we're using some of the dynamic of the push and pull that I showed you in the separations to push the box you're releasing over this direction.;8;28
19682;BKHAvX9rFw0;BKHAvX9rFw0-8-rgb_front;BKHAvX9rFw0_8;BKHAvX9rFw0_8-8-rgb_front;54.11;69.18;Then, of course, you have to catch in a snatch-like way the center box out from everything else without screwing up the pressure on the other boxes.;8;27
19683;BKHAvX9rFw0;BKHAvX9rFw0-8-rgb_front;BKHAvX9rFw0_9;BKHAvX9rFw0_9-8-rgb_front;69.83;71.33;It's a very dynamic trick.;8;5

19729;BOAuIAm-p_A;BOAuIAm-p_A-8-rgb_front;BOAuIAm-p_A_7;BOAuIAm-p_A_7-8-rgb_front;50.04;52.44;And we'll need some wooden sticks.;8;6

19732;BOBpYTUfuzs;BOBpYTUfuzs-8-rgb_front;BOBpYTUfuzs_0;BOBpYTUfuzs_0-8-rgb_front;0.42;0.66;Hi.;8;1
19733;BOBpYTUfuzs;BOBpYTUfuzs-8-rgb_front;BOBpYTUfuzs_1;BOBpYTUfuzs_1-8-rgb_front;0.66;4.56;In this segment we're going to talk a little bit about how to do the basic tip.;8;17
19734;BOBpYTUfuzs;BOBpYTUfuzs-8-rgb_front;BOBpYTUfuzs_10;BOBpYTUfuzs_10-8-rgb_front;42.09;45.77;So that's a single tip, you can actually go right and left.;8;12
19735;BOBpYTUfuzs;BOBpYTUfuzs-8-rgb_front;BOBpYTUfuzs_11;BOBpYTUfuzs_11-8-rgb_front;45.91;51.43;You can actually do multiples, little tips to a big tip.;8;11
19736;BOBpYTUfuzs;BOBpYTUfuzs-8-rgb_front;BOBpYTUfuzs_12;BOBpYTUfuzs_12-8-rgb_front;51.74;55.03;And what I like to do is actually, tip with my thumb.;8;12
19737;BOBpYTUfuzs;BOBpYTUfuzs-8-rgb_front;BOBpYTUfuzs_13;BOBpYTUfuzs_13-8-rgb_front;61.63;64.36;So those are some of the different ways that you can do the basic tip.;8;15
19738;BOBpYTUfuzs;BOBpYTUfuzs-8-rgb_front;BOBpYTUfuzs_2;BOBpYTUfuzs_2-8-rgb_front;5.15;14.5;Now a tip, can be done with your fingers, or your thumb, and the basic thing is, is that you want to make sure that you tip it with the pad of your fingers.;8;34
19739;BOBpYTUfuzs;BOBpYTUfuzs-8-rgb_front;BOBpYTUfuzs_3;BOBpYTUfuzs_3-8-rgb_front;14.5;16.69;You don't want to tip it on your nails necessarily.;8;10
19740;BOBpYTUfuzs;BOBpYTUfuzs-8-rgb_front;BOBpYTUfuzs_4;BOBpYTUfuzs_4-8-rgb_front;16.96;22.63;The easiest tips to do are with your pads, the soft part of your fingertips and that way it won't hurt.;8;21
19741;BOBpYTUfuzs;BOBpYTUfuzs-8-rgb_front;BOBpYTUfuzs_5;BOBpYTUfuzs_5-8-rgb_front;22.93;26.07;Also, another way that I do tips is kind of with my thumb.;8;13
19742;BOBpYTUfuzs;BOBpYTUfuzs-8-rgb_front;BOBpYTUfuzs_6;BOBpYTUfuzs_6-8-rgb_front;26.07;27.06;I hold it this way.;8;5
19743;BOBpYTUfuzs;BOBpYTUfuzs-8-rgb_front;BOBpYTUfuzs_7;BOBpYTUfuzs_7-8-rgb_front;27.45;31.89;So basically you want to put enough spin on it, either by yourself or with a throw.;8;17
19744;BOBpYTUfuzs;BOBpYTUfuzs-8-rgb_front;BOBpYTUfuzs_8;BOBpYTUfuzs_8-8-rgb_front;32.21;37.39;And a throw or spin would come in and you want to strike the Frisbee right in the middle.;8;19
19745;BOBpYTUfuzs;BOBpYTUfuzs-8-rgb_front;BOBpYTUfuzs_9;BOBpYTUfuzs_9-8-rgb_front;37.56;41.29;Right in the middle with the, with the fatty part of the tip of your finger.;8;16

19763;BQGyl8K8KZE;BQGyl8K8KZE-8-rgb_front;BQGyl8K8KZE_10;BQGyl8K8KZE_10-8-rgb_front;46.39;50.57;Then she'll come back and we'll go with the left leg.;8;11
19764;BQGyl8K8KZE;BQGyl8K8KZE-8-rgb_front;BQGyl8K8KZE_11;BQGyl8K8KZE_11-8-rgb_front;52.26;54.41;Down and back up.;8;4

19766;BQGyl8K8KZE;BQGyl8K8KZE-8-rgb_front;BQGyl8K8KZE_13;BQGyl8K8KZE_13-8-rgb_front;64.09;65.59;That's the alternating side lunge.;8;5
19767;BQGyl8K8KZE;BQGyl8K8KZE-8-rgb_front;BQGyl8K8KZE_2;BQGyl8K8KZE_2-8-rgb_front;9.52;13.67;Karie's going to start in her athletic stance with her feet just about shoulder-width apart.;8;15
19768;BQGyl8K8KZE;BQGyl8K8KZE-8-rgb_front;BQGyl8K8KZE_3;BQGyl8K8KZE_3-8-rgb_front;14.22;17.68;She's going to keep her torso, so from her hips to her shoulders, in line once again.;8;17
19769;BQGyl8K8KZE;BQGyl8K8KZE-8-rgb_front;BQGyl8K8KZE_4;BQGyl8K8KZE_4-8-rgb_front;17.94;27.64;She'll put her hands on her hips and she's going to step out with that left leg into a squatted position, and then she's going to come back up, and that will be one repetition.;8;35
19770;BQGyl8K8KZE;BQGyl8K8KZE-8-rgb_front;BQGyl8K8KZE_5;BQGyl8K8KZE_5-8-rgb_front;27.67;31.55;Now she'll come back to the right, squat, and then come back across.;8;13
19771;BQGyl8K8KZE;BQGyl8K8KZE-8-rgb_front;BQGyl8K8KZE_6;BQGyl8K8KZE_6-8-rgb_front;31.55;36.68;So she's not only getting the side lunge, which is working the hip flexors, but she's also getting a squat in this exercise.;8;23
19772;BQGyl8K8KZE;BQGyl8K8KZE-8-rgb_front;BQGyl8K8KZE_7;BQGyl8K8KZE_7-8-rgb_front;36.68;37.77;Let's do one more like that, Karie.;8;7

19774;BQGyl8K8KZE;BQGyl8K8KZE-8-rgb_front;BQGyl8K8KZE_9;BQGyl8K8KZE_9-8-rgb_front;45.56;46.1;There you go.;8;3

19816;BRa6-tUUd0E;BRa6-tUUd0E-8-rgb_front;BRa6-tUUd0E_12;BRa6-tUUd0E_12-8-rgb_front;81.95;100.02;The trails on this map are in red, the contour lines are brown, rivers and water are all blue and I can see if I am going to be traveling at the top of peaks or if I would be down in a valley near the shelters or if there is water nearby.;8;53

19820;BRa6-tUUd0E;BRa6-tUUd0E-8-rgb_front;BRa6-tUUd0E_2;BRa6-tUUd0E_2-8-rgb_front;8.66;13.66;When reading a map of when you are going hiking, there are some things to look at right away.;8;19

19829;BT6nLJAINgo;BT6nLJAINgo-8-rgb_front;BT6nLJAINgo_1;BT6nLJAINgo_1-8-rgb_front;9.64;11.81;First you're going to need your strap.;8;7
19830;BT6nLJAINgo;BT6nLJAINgo-8-rgb_front;BT6nLJAINgo_10;BT6nLJAINgo_10-8-rgb_front;39.32;41.51;And you can leave a little extra on the bottom.;8;10
19831;BT6nLJAINgo;BT6nLJAINgo-8-rgb_front;BT6nLJAINgo_11;BT6nLJAINgo_11-8-rgb_front;41.72;43.3;Also use scissors.;8;3
19832;BT6nLJAINgo;BT6nLJAINgo-8-rgb_front;BT6nLJAINgo_12;BT6nLJAINgo_12-8-rgb_front;43.36;44.72;Not your fabric scissors.;8;4

19835;BT6nLJAINgo;BT6nLJAINgo-8-rgb_front;BT6nLJAINgo_15;BT6nLJAINgo_15-8-rgb_front;48.37;54.62;It can come off a little bit but you want to make sure it's around the edges because that's what's going to hold up the ear on your purse.;8;29
19836;BT6nLJAINgo;BT6nLJAINgo-8-rgb_front;BT6nLJAINgo_16;BT6nLJAINgo_16-8-rgb_front;55.21;61.7;Also, this wire is too short for my strap but the paddle wire is great.;8;15
19837;BT6nLJAINgo;BT6nLJAINgo-8-rgb_front;BT6nLJAINgo_17;BT6nLJAINgo_17-8-rgb_front;62.54;64.78;We undo that, measure it out.;8;6

19840;BT6nLJAINgo;BT6nLJAINgo-8-rgb_front;BT6nLJAINgo_2;BT6nLJAINgo_2-8-rgb_front;12.11;16.24;You're going to need your ear shape and you're going to need your floral wire.;8;15

19842;BT6nLJAINgo;BT6nLJAINgo-8-rgb_front;BT6nLJAINgo_21;BT6nLJAINgo_21-8-rgb_front;75.81;78.63;Use other scissors or wire cutters to cut this.;8;9

19847;BT6nLJAINgo;BT6nLJAINgo-8-rgb_front;BT6nLJAINgo_5;BT6nLJAINgo_5-8-rgb_front;22.37;29.52;So now I want you to take your wire and measure it all the way around your ear.;8;18
19848;BT6nLJAINgo;BT6nLJAINgo-8-rgb_front;BT6nLJAINgo_6;BT6nLJAINgo_6-8-rgb_front;30.87;32.58;And you don't have to go around the bottom.;8;9
19849;BT6nLJAINgo;BT6nLJAINgo-8-rgb_front;BT6nLJAINgo_7;BT6nLJAINgo_7-8-rgb_front;32.58;34.93;Just around three sides is fine.;8;6
19850;BT6nLJAINgo;BT6nLJAINgo-8-rgb_front;BT6nLJAINgo_8;BT6nLJAINgo_8-8-rgb_front;35.18;37.39;But you want to make sure it goes around the edges.;8;11
19851;BT6nLJAINgo;BT6nLJAINgo-8-rgb_front;BT6nLJAINgo_9;BT6nLJAINgo_9-8-rgb_front;37.39;38.9;And it doesn't have to be exact.;8;7

19907;BXa-8t_3mHs;BXa-8t_3mHs-8-rgb_front;BXa-8t_3mHs_21;BXa-8t_3mHs_21-8-rgb_front;137.86;145.09;In this case I've got a table vice that I'm using and I've actually got the piece where it's elevated just a little bit.;8;24
19908;BXa-8t_3mHs;BXa-8t_3mHs-8-rgb_front;BXa-8t_3mHs_22;BXa-8t_3mHs_22-8-rgb_front;145.09;149.91;And that'll help you in making sure that you make good cuts with your plane.;8;15
19909;BXa-8t_3mHs;BXa-8t_3mHs-8-rgb_front;BXa-8t_3mHs_23;BXa-8t_3mHs_23-8-rgb_front;150.37;152.58;So I'm Tim Gipson, and that's how to use a hand plane.;8;12
19910;BXa-8t_3mHs;BXa-8t_3mHs-8-rgb_front;BXa-8t_3mHs_3;BXa-8t_3mHs_3-8-rgb_front;4.85;12.95;Now a hand plane is a very useful tool when you actually want to smooth out or take a curve out of the edge of the board.;8;27
19911;BXa-8t_3mHs;BXa-8t_3mHs-8-rgb_front;BXa-8t_3mHs_4;BXa-8t_3mHs_4-8-rgb_front;13.74;20.28;Typically you'll do this when you want to take two boards, such as this, and you want to glue them up to make a larger panel.;8;26
19912;BXa-8t_3mHs;BXa-8t_3mHs-8-rgb_front;BXa-8t_3mHs_5;BXa-8t_3mHs_5-8-rgb_front;23.12;30.64;Now the important thing when you get ready to use a hand plane is, on the blade, you want to make sure you always start with a sharp blade.;8;29
19913;BXa-8t_3mHs;BXa-8t_3mHs-8-rgb_front;BXa-8t_3mHs_6;BXa-8t_3mHs_6-8-rgb_front;31.18;37.66;So, if...it's recommended before you start using your plane that you take your blade and you hone it.;8;18
19914;BXa-8t_3mHs;BXa-8t_3mHs-8-rgb_front;BXa-8t_3mHs_7;BXa-8t_3mHs_7-8-rgb_front;37.66;44.84;And you can hone it on any kind of a sharpening block with a little bit of oil, which, this one's ready to go.;8;24
19915;BXa-8t_3mHs;BXa-8t_3mHs-8-rgb_front;BXa-8t_3mHs_8;BXa-8t_3mHs_8-8-rgb_front;45.09;50.7;Now, the next thing you want to do, is, you want to check the setting of your blade.;8;18

20033;BdWaaSDDu6Q;BdWaaSDDu6Q-8-rgb_front;BdWaaSDDu6Q_4;BdWaaSDDu6Q_4-8-rgb_front;18.49;28.77;And most the time you can see that, if you look, (hopefully you can pick this up here) but you'll see high speed, it'll usually be stamped right on it.;8;30
20034;BdWaaSDDu6Q;BdWaaSDDu6Q-8-rgb_front;BdWaaSDDu6Q_5;BdWaaSDDu6Q_5-8-rgb_front;29.94;35.15;Now what that is, is a specific type of tool steel that holds up very well to grinding.;8;18
20035;BdWaaSDDu6Q;BdWaaSDDu6Q-8-rgb_front;BdWaaSDDu6Q_6;BdWaaSDDu6Q_6-8-rgb_front;35.52;41.46;In other words if you blew when you grind it, if you blew the edge, it won't lose it's temper, that's probably the most important thing.;8;26
20036;BdWaaSDDu6Q;BdWaaSDDu6Q-8-rgb_front;BdWaaSDDu6Q_7;BdWaaSDDu6Q_7-8-rgb_front;42.25;49.99;The next most important thing about high speed tool steel, is that when you- it has good wear resistance on it.;8;21
20037;BdWaaSDDu6Q;BdWaaSDDu6Q-8-rgb_front;BdWaaSDDu6Q_8;BdWaaSDDu6Q_8-8-rgb_front;50.66;63.81;Now the tools that we have, probably 30 or 40 years ago, if you've got some that are that old, and it's not hard to have, because if you've kept a lathe for a number of years, you usually had a set of tools, it came with carbon steel.;8;49
20038;Bda6fYAIFgg;Bda6fYAIFgg-8-rgb_front;Bda6fYAIFgg_10;Bda6fYAIFgg_10-8-rgb_front;89.27;94.88;And this material it's a plunge bra and this material on this bra is again silky smooth.;8;17
20039;Bda6fYAIFgg;Bda6fYAIFgg-8-rgb_front;Bda6fYAIFgg_11;Bda6fYAIFgg_11-8-rgb_front;94.88;100.9;It comes in a variety of colors and again wonderful underneath a t-shirt, a sweater, you name it.;8;18
20040;Bda6fYAIFgg;Bda6fYAIFgg-8-rgb_front;Bda6fYAIFgg_3;Bda6fYAIFgg_3-8-rgb_front;31.12;38.51;"This is what we typically call a t-shirt bra; and just a great all over fit and coverage.";8;18

20042;Bda6fYAIFgg;Bda6fYAIFgg-8-rgb_front;Bda6fYAIFgg_5;Bda6fYAIFgg_5-8-rgb_front;45.55;50.81;And secondly we have another basic t-shirt bra again but this time it's just in cotton.;8;16
20043;Bda6fYAIFgg;Bda6fYAIFgg-8-rgb_front;Bda6fYAIFgg_6;Bda6fYAIFgg_6-8-rgb_front;51.04;55.82;And again it's a plunge bra and it has the underwire and no padding.;8;14
20044;Bda6fYAIFgg;Bda6fYAIFgg-8-rgb_front;Bda6fYAIFgg_7;Bda6fYAIFgg_7-8-rgb_front;56.05;66.0;And you know it just is really good underneath t-shirts as well but it's probably our second choice recommendation.;8;19
20045;Bda6fYAIFgg;Bda6fYAIFgg-8-rgb_front;Bda6fYAIFgg_8;Bda6fYAIFgg_8-8-rgb_front;66.97;73.81;And then third we have again another, what we call t-shirt bra, but this time it does not have any underwire.;8;21
20046;Bda6fYAIFgg;Bda6fYAIFgg-8-rgb_front;Bda6fYAIFgg_9;Bda6fYAIFgg_9-8-rgb_front;74.3;88.84;A lot of our customers more and more frequently request a bra that does not have underwire but this does give the support that people need because of the band underneath the breast it is sewn in such a way so that you do get the support you need without underwire.;8;51

20141;BlhCuryvt88;BlhCuryvt88-8-rgb_front;BlhCuryvt88_16_17_18;BlhCuryvt88_16_17_18-8-rgb_front;42.14;48.97;Now this is, this is something, why you just kind of, learn. Where that is. It's a trial and error process.;8;21

20145;BlhCuryvt88;BlhCuryvt88-8-rgb_front;BlhCuryvt88_22;BlhCuryvt88_22-8-rgb_front;57.76;62.02;And we do that, with what's called the claw.;8;9
20146;BlhCuryvt88;BlhCuryvt88-8-rgb_front;BlhCuryvt88_23;BlhCuryvt88_23-8-rgb_front;63.09;65.71;And you use your hand like this.;8;7
20147;BlhCuryvt88;BlhCuryvt88-8-rgb_front;BlhCuryvt88_24;BlhCuryvt88_24-8-rgb_front;65.74;67.76;And you put it inside the pot.;8;7
20148;BlhCuryvt88;BlhCuryvt88-8-rgb_front;BlhCuryvt88_25;BlhCuryvt88_25-8-rgb_front;68.42;71.15;And what I'm going to be doing, is pushing down.;8;10
20149;BlhCuryvt88;BlhCuryvt88-8-rgb_front;BlhCuryvt88_26;BlhCuryvt88_26-8-rgb_front;71.76;73.26;And pulling towards me.;8;4

20151;BlhCuryvt88;BlhCuryvt88-8-rgb_front;BlhCuryvt88_28;BlhCuryvt88_28-8-rgb_front;79.62;80.88;And so, here we go.;8;5

20190;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_0;BoBx1pDyFog_0-8-rgb_front;0.81;3.75;The very first cast we're going to cover is the Roll cast.;8;12
20191;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_1;BoBx1pDyFog_1-8-rgb_front;4.31;13.71;And, the reason why we have a Roll cast and how it got it's name is the cast occurs because the line is rolling along the water.;8;27
20192;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_10;BoBx1pDyFog_10-8-rgb_front;70.66;78.41;The other thing that the Roll cast does for you, it builds upon how the line and the rod relationship work.;8;21
20193;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_11;BoBx1pDyFog_11-8-rgb_front;78.41;83.13;And, what it amounts to, is every cast starts out with a tempo or a speed.;8;16
20194;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_12;BoBx1pDyFog_12-8-rgb_front;83.19;87.94;So, you start out slow, you go medium, and then you finish with a quick stroke.;8;16
20195;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_13;BoBx1pDyFog_13-8-rgb_front;88.44;96.72;So, that enables the line to transfer the energy to the rod, and then with the stop, the line goes off the end.;8;23
20196;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_14;BoBx1pDyFog_14-8-rgb_front;96.76;100.33;So, it's slow, medium, quick to a stop.;8;8
20197;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_15;BoBx1pDyFog_15-8-rgb_front;101.22;102.88;Now, I mentioned the word stop.;8;6
20198;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_16;BoBx1pDyFog_16-8-rgb_front;103.14;112.41;Stop is where the transfers of energy occurs off of the rod tip and then that, by stopping the rod, the line pivots off the end and keeps going.;8;29
20199;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_17;BoBx1pDyFog_17-8-rgb_front;112.88;115.89;The stop is one of the most important things in a fly cast.;8;13
20200;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_18;BoBx1pDyFog_18-8-rgb_front;116.78;121.77;So now let's cover the basics and build upon the Roll cast.;8;12
20201;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_19;BoBx1pDyFog_19-8-rgb_front;121.8;127.37;I might also mention that a lot of people think that they should cover the overhead cast first.;8;18
20202;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_2;BoBx1pDyFog_2-8-rgb_front;14.0;19.02;In this case we will build and demonstrate using the example of the grass.;8;14
20203;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_20;BoBx1pDyFog_20-8-rgb_front;127.73;133.12;Well, the overhead cast, it gets to a back cast and a forward cast, so you're learning two things.;8;19
20204;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_21;BoBx1pDyFog_21-8-rgb_front;133.35;137.07;That's why I think it's so important to cover the Roll cast first.;8;13
20205;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_22;BoBx1pDyFog_22-8-rgb_front;137.41;141.04;So you understand the speed of the cast and the importance of the stop.;8;14
20206;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_23;BoBx1pDyFog_23-8-rgb_front;142.18;145.81;So now let's build upon that and start our demonstration.;8;10
20207;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_24;BoBx1pDyFog_24-8-rgb_front;147.57;153.17;The basis of every cast is every cast needs to start with the tip down.;8;15
20208;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_25;BoBx1pDyFog_25-8-rgb_front;153.2;162.35;The reason that, the reason why that is so important is because as you begin to lift the rod up the line will begin to bend the tip of the rod.;8;31
20209;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_26;BoBx1pDyFog_26-8-rgb_front;162.61;169.43;So every cast, no matter what cast you start, should begin with the tip in the water, or in this case, on the ground.;8;24
20210;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_27;BoBx1pDyFog_27-8-rgb_front;170.2;174.36;The lift is one of the most important things that goes into every single cast.;8;15
20211;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_28;BoBx1pDyFog_28-8-rgb_front;174.87;181.52;So what we're going to do is we're going to lift our arms, straight like this here, and then what we're going to do is we're going to bring the rod back.;8;32
20212;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_29;BoBx1pDyFog_29-8-rgb_front;181.52;188.81;If you bring the rod back, then essentially, the line will begin to load from the rod coming back.;8;19
20213;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_3;BoBx1pDyFog_3-8-rgb_front;19.41;28.25;Also, what the Roll cast provides is the opportunity to cast and fish when there's bushes or obstructions behind you or along side of you, you can still fish.;8;29
20214;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_30;BoBx1pDyFog_30-8-rgb_front;189.14;197.53;Now what we're going to do, as we lift it back to this position, what we're going to do is we're going to slide the line back behind us.;8;29
20215;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_31;BoBx1pDyFog_31-8-rgb_front;198.09;199.81;Did you see how I slid it back?;8;8
20216;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_32;BoBx1pDyFog_32-8-rgb_front;199.94;202.38;Sliding back is the most important thing.;8;7
20217;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_33;BoBx1pDyFog_33-8-rgb_front;202.83;208.57;Essentially, if you raise it up, then the wind could catch it and put your fly right back into the bushes.;8;21
20218;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_34;BoBx1pDyFog_34-8-rgb_front;209.23;213.89;So, now we are in to what you'd call the key position for setting up the Roll cast.;8;18
20219;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_35;BoBx1pDyFog_35-8-rgb_front;214.24;219.95;You'll notice here that the distance between the rod and my forearm or wrist is 45 degrees.;8;17
20220;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_36;BoBx1pDyFog_36-8-rgb_front;220.19;222.52;That enables a nice casting stroke.;8;6
20221;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_37;BoBx1pDyFog_37-8-rgb_front;223.33;229.8;You start out slow, we go medium, and then we finish fast and the line goes out.;8;17
20222;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_38;BoBx1pDyFog_38-8-rgb_front;230.83;233.38;OKay, now I'll just pick up the tempo so you can see this.;8;13
20223;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_39;BoBx1pDyFog_39-8-rgb_front;233.91;244.82;There's a lift, it comes back, it goes up in to the key position, there's your 45, slow, medium, quick, and the cast goes out.;8;25
20224;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_4;BoBx1pDyFog_4-8-rgb_front;28.75;44.45;Where, is if you only learn the overhead cast first, which the line goes up in the air behind you, you can see what happens is the line would go right up in the bushes and you'd have to essentially spend the money to get another fly, you take the time, you'd lose your leader and everything else.;8;58
20225;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_40;BoBx1pDyFog_40-8-rgb_front;245.95;253.17;What you notice, there, is the smoothness that occurs in the cast and how I transitioned my weight.;8;18
20226;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_41;BoBx1pDyFog_41-8-rgb_front;253.54;258.66;First from the back foot into the forward foot.;8;9
20227;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_42;BoBx1pDyFog_42-8-rgb_front;260.57;272.66;Lift, back, the rod comes up to the 45 degree position, the upper arms is level, now we will do the cast.;8;22
20228;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_43;BoBx1pDyFog_43-8-rgb_front;272.96;278.39;What you'll notice is that I go into the cast from the back position to the slow to the forward.;8;20
20229;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_44;BoBx1pDyFog_44-8-rgb_front;278.89;283.96;Now, this 45 degree angle maintains as we go into the casting stroke.;8;13
20230;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_45;BoBx1pDyFog_45-8-rgb_front;284.44;291.94;So now we have the slow, the medium, now what we're going to do we're going to finish with a flick of the wrist and that will send the line on its way.;8;33
20231;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_46;BoBx1pDyFog_46-8-rgb_front;292.08;292.5;Flick.;8;1

20233;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_48;BoBx1pDyFog_48-8-rgb_front;294.68;294.93;OKay.;8;1

20235;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_5;BoBx1pDyFog_5-8-rgb_front;44.7;49.25;So, to properly learn the Roll cast is one of the most advantages that you have.;8;16
20236;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_6;BoBx1pDyFog_6-8-rgb_front;49.77;58.29;In fact, as a guide and outfitter, I can tell you from talking to fellow guides, is most people on guide trips do not even know what the Roll cast is.;8;31
20237;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_7;BoBx1pDyFog_7-8-rgb_front;58.32;59.63;Seventy percent do not.;8;4
20238;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_8;BoBx1pDyFog_8-8-rgb_front;59.88;60.19;OKay?;8;1
20239;BoBx1pDyFog;BoBx1pDyFog-8-rgb_front;BoBx1pDyFog_9;BoBx1pDyFog_9-8-rgb_front;60.44;69.93;So, what we're going to do is we are going to start out with the Roll cast because what the Roll cast provides for you is the forward movement of every single cast.;8;33

20628;CH7AviIr0-0;CH7AviIr0-0-8-rgb_front;CH7AviIr0-0_4;CH7AviIr0-0_4-8-rgb_front;20.53;33.05;The application of mascara can be very scary to makeup artist and scary to clients, so really reasuring them that we know what we're doing, we have a steady hand, and we have a great technique for applying mascara will help them feel at ease.;8;45
20629;CH7AviIr0-0;CH7AviIr0-0-8-rgb_front;CH7AviIr0-0_5;CH7AviIr0-0_5-8-rgb_front;34.04;38.68;What we're going to do is we're going to take that mascara and remove the wand.;8;16
20630;CH7AviIr0-0;CH7AviIr0-0-8-rgb_front;CH7AviIr0-0_6;CH7AviIr0-0_6-8-rgb_front;40.02;44.9;We're then going to dip our mascara wand just once in.;8;11

20632;CH7AviIr0-0;CH7AviIr0-0-8-rgb_front;CH7AviIr0-0_8;CH7AviIr0-0_8-8-rgb_front;50.96;53.85;Just once in and once out will get plenty of product.;8;11

20651;CITqUVKneOc;CITqUVKneOc-8-rgb_front;CITqUVKneOc_1;CITqUVKneOc_1-8-rgb_front;6.23;12.07;And, we're going to talk about what happens when your car battery dies, how to select a new battery, and how to see what the problem is.;8;27
20652;CITqUVKneOc;CITqUVKneOc-8-rgb_front;CITqUVKneOc_10;CITqUVKneOc_10-8-rgb_front;51.45;63.76;As you can see, this wrench is long enough to contact between the two battery terminals which could result in a very powerful spark, and liquid lead or metal shooting off in those sparks.;8;34
20653;CITqUVKneOc;CITqUVKneOc-8-rgb_front;CITqUVKneOc_11;CITqUVKneOc_11-8-rgb_front;64.11;71.31;A good way to avoid causing sparks at the battery with your wrench is to begin by disconnecting the negative terminal first.;8;22
20654;CITqUVKneOc;CITqUVKneOc-8-rgb_front;CITqUVKneOc_12;CITqUVKneOc_12-8-rgb_front;71.82;81.32;That way, when your touching the terminal with your wrench, if the wrench touches any other part of the car, there's not going to be a difference in currant resulting in a spark.;8;33
20655;CITqUVKneOc;CITqUVKneOc-8-rgb_front;CITqUVKneOc_13;CITqUVKneOc_13-8-rgb_front;81.8;91.15;If you start with the positive terminal while the battery is connected and you touch the body of the car, you're going to arc twelve volts from the battery to the car because there's a difference in voltage.;8;38
20656;CITqUVKneOc;CITqUVKneOc-8-rgb_front;CITqUVKneOc_14;CITqUVKneOc_14-8-rgb_front;91.9;94.57;And, you're electrical system controls all that power.;8;8
20657;CITqUVKneOc;CITqUVKneOc-8-rgb_front;CITqUVKneOc_15;CITqUVKneOc_15-8-rgb_front;95.21;100.82;So, you want to be careful and if you're not experienced, maybe you should cover your wrench with electrical tape except for the very tip.;8;25
20658;CITqUVKneOc;CITqUVKneOc-8-rgb_front;CITqUVKneOc_2;CITqUVKneOc_2-8-rgb_front;12.86;15.82;So, the first step is we're going to see if the terminals are tight.;8;14
20659;CITqUVKneOc;CITqUVKneOc-8-rgb_front;CITqUVKneOc_3;CITqUVKneOc_3-8-rgb_front;16.8;29.06;Now, if you wiggle the terminals and they twist, sometimes that means there's enough of a gap between the terminal and the clamp that there's corrosion in there that you can't see.;8;32
20660;CITqUVKneOc;CITqUVKneOc-8-rgb_front;CITqUVKneOc_4;CITqUVKneOc_4-8-rgb_front;29.3;33.36;So, let's pull these terminals off and look inside there and see what it really looks like.;8;17
20661;CITqUVKneOc;CITqUVKneOc-8-rgb_front;CITqUVKneOc_5;CITqUVKneOc_5-8-rgb_front;33.83;38.43;So, we're going to remove these terminals with a wrench.;8;10
20662;CITqUVKneOc;CITqUVKneOc-8-rgb_front;CITqUVKneOc_6;CITqUVKneOc_6-8-rgb_front;38.43;42.14;This car is foreign, Japanese made, so I'm using a metric wrench.;8;12
20663;CITqUVKneOc;CITqUVKneOc-8-rgb_front;CITqUVKneOc_7;CITqUVKneOc_7-8-rgb_front;42.14;43.96;It happens to be a 13mm wrench.;8;7
20664;CITqUVKneOc;CITqUVKneOc-8-rgb_front;CITqUVKneOc_8;CITqUVKneOc_8-8-rgb_front;44.33;46.67;Now, the wrench is metal, and it's a very good conductor.;8;11
20665;CITqUVKneOc;CITqUVKneOc-8-rgb_front;CITqUVKneOc_9;CITqUVKneOc_9-8-rgb_front;47.18;51.0;The battery creates a lot of electricity between these two poles.;8;11
20682;CJ8RyW9pzKU;CJ8RyW9pzKU-8-rgb_front;CJ8RyW9pzKU_0;CJ8RyW9pzKU_0-8-rgb_front;0.0;6.29;GINA KENNEDY: Hanumanasana is a pose that even some practice yogis are a little bit nervous about trying.;8;18

21198;CiSoUHVR7UM;CiSoUHVR7UM-8-rgb_front;CiSoUHVR7UM_6;CiSoUHVR7UM_6-8-rgb_front;25.65;26.94;It makes an easy bandage.;8;5
21199;CiSoUHVR7UM;CiSoUHVR7UM-8-rgb_front;CiSoUHVR7UM_7;CiSoUHVR7UM_7-8-rgb_front;27.11;32.2;You can even go around the party or your Halloween gathering and bandage people up throughout the evening.;8;18
21200;CiSoUHVR7UM;CiSoUHVR7UM-8-rgb_front;CiSoUHVR7UM_8;CiSoUHVR7UM_8-8-rgb_front;32.38;34.56;Simply applying by unrolling it over.;8;6
21201;CiSoUHVR7UM;CiSoUHVR7UM-8-rgb_front;CiSoUHVR7UM_9;CiSoUHVR7UM_9-8-rgb_front;34.56;36.0;It is nice and resilient.;8;5

21242;CmFW0P_9Tmw;CmFW0P_9Tmw-8-rgb_front;CmFW0P_9Tmw_1;CmFW0P_9Tmw_1-8-rgb_front;8.26;10.59;Now we talked about this thing called the swing.;8;9

21245;CmFW0P_9Tmw;CmFW0P_9Tmw-8-rgb_front;CmFW0P_9Tmw_12;CmFW0P_9Tmw_12-8-rgb_front;70.14;72.55;This is you here and you are the dealer.;8;9

21251;CmFW0P_9Tmw;CmFW0P_9Tmw-8-rgb_front;CmFW0P_9Tmw_18;CmFW0P_9Tmw_18-8-rgb_front;109.82;117.22;"The reason for that is, you're partner has put up a big old five if you had all those spades; he's bidding five on side suits.";8;26
21252;CmFW0P_9Tmw;CmFW0P_9Tmw-8-rgb_front;CmFW0P_9Tmw_19;CmFW0P_9Tmw_19-8-rgb_front;117.94;126.83;If by chance somebody comes in and trumps one of his five tricks and you only have four you're not going to be able to pick him up because, you already bid the four that you expected to take.;8;39
21253;CmFW0P_9Tmw;CmFW0P_9Tmw-8-rgb_front;CmFW0P_9Tmw_2;CmFW0P_9Tmw_2-8-rgb_front;12.32;17.01;The word swing has nothing to do with the word playground and has nothing to do with dancing.;8;18

21255;CmFW0P_9Tmw;CmFW0P_9Tmw-8-rgb_front;CmFW0P_9Tmw_21;CmFW0P_9Tmw_21-8-rgb_front;136.64;147.29;So, safety in contracts, safety in bidding, and particularly when you're bidding numerical bids, remember the average bid of a hand is eleven tricks.;8;24
21256;CmFW0P_9Tmw;CmFW0P_9Tmw-8-rgb_front;CmFW0P_9Tmw_22;CmFW0P_9Tmw_22-8-rgb_front;148.1;156.76;So when you start pushing it to twelve, when you start pushing it to thirteen, then you're taking full responsibility, you're telling your partner I probably have two extra tricks.;8;30
21257;CmFW0P_9Tmw;CmFW0P_9Tmw-8-rgb_front;CmFW0P_9Tmw_23;CmFW0P_9Tmw_23-8-rgb_front;157.06;159.92;So again, bid slightly conservatively.;8;5
21258;CmFW0P_9Tmw;CmFW0P_9Tmw-8-rgb_front;CmFW0P_9Tmw_3;CmFW0P_9Tmw_3-8-rgb_front;17.24;27.84;It has to do with the loss of points versus the gain of points, and again if it's a low level bid it's really not going to matter too much, it's not going to hurt you too much.;8;38
21259;CmFW0P_9Tmw;CmFW0P_9Tmw-8-rgb_front;CmFW0P_9Tmw_4;CmFW0P_9Tmw_4-8-rgb_front;27.84;37.12;Any bids from say, two because, if you each bid one, that's the most even a two bid can split.;8;20

21268;CnD-hSIeaMg;CnD-hSIeaMg-8-rgb_front;CnD-hSIeaMg_13;CnD-hSIeaMg_13-8-rgb_front;69.23;73.22;You bring the club around and throw, bring around and throw.;8;11
21269;CnD-hSIeaMg;CnD-hSIeaMg-8-rgb_front;CnD-hSIeaMg_14;CnD-hSIeaMg_14-8-rgb_front;73.65;83.62;So practice this throw with each hand over and over trying to get double spin height and then we'll work on incorporating that into a pattern.;8;26
21270;CnD-hSIeaMg;CnD-hSIeaMg-8-rgb_front;CnD-hSIeaMg_9;CnD-hSIeaMg_9-8-rgb_front;43.97;55.78;What you need to do, is you're going to have your hand come around from this throwing pattern, pretty high up your back around here, and from here you want to be continuing the throw naturally and letting your wrists spin the club up.;8;44
21271;CnvqUIXeXmE;CnvqUIXeXmE-8-rgb_front;CnvqUIXeXmE_0;CnvqUIXeXmE_0-8-rgb_front;0.89;13.22;We're going to help this rider now apply some of her knowledge of communication with hand and leg to that forward moving horse that we now want to be balanced, smooth and light on their forehand.;8;36
21272;CnvqUIXeXmE;CnvqUIXeXmE-8-rgb_front;CnvqUIXeXmE_1;CnvqUIXeXmE_1-8-rgb_front;13.54;20.19;Horses inherently like to go out and do their work in a similar sloppy fashion to many of us in our daily lives.;8;23

21420;CyLfNgMZmc0;CyLfNgMZmc0-8-rgb_front;CyLfNgMZmc0_0;CyLfNgMZmc0_0-8-rgb_front;0.94;8.06;Side Flexion Sitting On The Ball With The Weights By The Side is an option if you can do this exercise standing up.;8;23
21421;CyLfNgMZmc0;CyLfNgMZmc0-8-rgb_front;CyLfNgMZmc0_1;CyLfNgMZmc0_1-8-rgb_front;8.29;16.77;I'm going to warn you that you must have small weights because if the weights are too big, they're really going to interfere, the size is going to interfere with the ball.;8;32
21422;CyLfNgMZmc0;CyLfNgMZmc0-8-rgb_front;CyLfNgMZmc0_10;CyLfNgMZmc0_10-8-rgb_front;69.78;74.2;So you're kind of have a smaller base for your support of, on the ball that you're sitting.;8;18
21423;CyLfNgMZmc0;CyLfNgMZmc0-8-rgb_front;CyLfNgMZmc0_11;CyLfNgMZmc0_11-8-rgb_front;74.51;89.96;And again, you want to make sure that you keep the weights small, or maybe you have wrist weights, wrist bands that you can wear instead because weights are going to be a problem with the size and the ball being right there where the path of the weights need to be.;8;52
21424;CyLfNgMZmc0;CyLfNgMZmc0-8-rgb_front;CyLfNgMZmc0_12;CyLfNgMZmc0_12-8-rgb_front;90.03;98.41;So again, also, keep in mind that the head wants to go with the rest of the spine, none of that or none of that.;8;25
21425;CyLfNgMZmc0;CyLfNgMZmc0-8-rgb_front;CyLfNgMZmc0_13;CyLfNgMZmc0_13-8-rgb_front;98.99;112.48;So you want to make sure that maybe you check in the mirror or in the reflection or somebody, spot you for a bit until your muscle memory develops, do a feel on each side and you're on a way to a happy, healthy core.;8;45
21426;CyLfNgMZmc0;CyLfNgMZmc0-8-rgb_front;CyLfNgMZmc0_14;CyLfNgMZmc0_14-8-rgb_front;112.74;113.4;See you soon.;8;3
21427;CyLfNgMZmc0;CyLfNgMZmc0-8-rgb_front;CyLfNgMZmc0_2;CyLfNgMZmc0_2-8-rgb_front;16.77;20.37;So it's not a good idea if you're ready to use heavier weights.;8;13
21428;CyLfNgMZmc0;CyLfNgMZmc0-8-rgb_front;CyLfNgMZmc0_3;CyLfNgMZmc0_3-8-rgb_front;20.4;29.55;This is for lighter weights or no weights if you're starting to train your core and you need to start just learning how to do the exercise.;8;27
21429;CyLfNgMZmc0;CyLfNgMZmc0-8-rgb_front;CyLfNgMZmc0_4;CyLfNgMZmc0_4-8-rgb_front;29.83;38.43;Now sitting on the fitness ball, it's going to take you to where you're sitting on your sit bones and you're spine is going to be align, shoulders down and back.;8;31
21430;CyLfNgMZmc0;CyLfNgMZmc0-8-rgb_front;CyLfNgMZmc0_5;CyLfNgMZmc0_5-8-rgb_front;38.63;41.4;So you're chest is open and up.;8;7
21431;CyLfNgMZmc0;CyLfNgMZmc0-8-rgb_front;CyLfNgMZmc0_6;CyLfNgMZmc0_6-8-rgb_front;41.6;43.45;So none of this, okay.;8;5
21432;CyLfNgMZmc0;CyLfNgMZmc0-8-rgb_front;CyLfNgMZmc0_7;CyLfNgMZmc0_7-8-rgb_front;43.66;51.07;Now, the weights by the side, you're going to keep your head align as you take an inhale, and take a side, it's like a side crunch.;8;27
21433;CyLfNgMZmc0;CyLfNgMZmc0-8-rgb_front;CyLfNgMZmc0_8;CyLfNgMZmc0_8-8-rgb_front;52.28;64.1;Exhale as you're coming up, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.;8;9
21434;CyLfNgMZmc0;CyLfNgMZmc0-8-rgb_front;CyLfNgMZmc0_9;CyLfNgMZmc0_9-8-rgb_front;64.35;69.47;Now way to make it a little more challenging on the balance is maybe lifting your heels off the floor.;8;20
21435;CylhtiqMiTc;CylhtiqMiTc-8-rgb_front;CylhtiqMiTc_0;CylhtiqMiTc_0-8-rgb_front;0.61;3.02;This exercise is Large Arm Circles.;8;6
21436;CylhtiqMiTc;CylhtiqMiTc-8-rgb_front;CylhtiqMiTc_1;CylhtiqMiTc_1-8-rgb_front;3.25;7.9;And once again, we're going to spread the band out flat and we're going to sit in the middle of it.;8;21
21437;CylhtiqMiTc;CylhtiqMiTc-8-rgb_front;CylhtiqMiTc_2;CylhtiqMiTc_2-8-rgb_front;8.22;24.86;Grabbing the ends of the band between the forefingers and the thumb, we're going to go ahead and take a nice inhale, exhale stabilize the abdominals and bring the arms up, inhale back, exhale around.;8;35
21438;CylhtiqMiTc;CylhtiqMiTc-8-rgb_front;CylhtiqMiTc_3;CylhtiqMiTc_3-8-rgb_front;24.92;28.09;Inhale up, exhale.;8;3

21441;CylhtiqMiTc;CylhtiqMiTc-8-rgb_front;CylhtiqMiTc_6;CylhtiqMiTc_6-8-rgb_front;36.4;37.72;Now we're going to reverse.;8;5
21442;CylhtiqMiTc;CylhtiqMiTc-8-rgb_front;CylhtiqMiTc_7;CylhtiqMiTc_7-8-rgb_front;38.1;42.88;Inhale lower, exhale up and over.;8;6

21444;CylhtiqMiTc;CylhtiqMiTc-8-rgb_front;CylhtiqMiTc_9;CylhtiqMiTc_9-8-rgb_front;47.8;60.8;Now I do have a slight bend in my elbow, designed to be more of a micro bend than an actual bend, because we really don't ever want to lock any of our joints, whether it's the knees or the elbows.;8;41
21452;CzXICdEaWaY;CzXICdEaWaY-8-rgb_front;CzXICdEaWaY_0;CzXICdEaWaY_0-8-rgb_front;0.62;13.63;CLANCY ROSE: All right, so now we are going to move on to mixing your breve, unless you already have just a quart of--or you already have some half and half ready and then steaming the milk for the double breve latte.;8;42
21453;CzXICdEaWaY;CzXICdEaWaY-8-rgb_front;CzXICdEaWaY_1;CzXICdEaWaY_1-8-rgb_front;13.63;21.42;Here today I have just a gallon of whole milk and a [SOUNDS LIKE] thing of heavy whipping cream.;8;19
21454;CzXICdEaWaY;CzXICdEaWaY-8-rgb_front;CzXICdEaWaY_10;CzXICdEaWaY_10-8-rgb_front;81.05;90.63;Then you are going to drop down the pitcher so that the tip of the steam wand is just right at or right above the surface of the milk.;8;29
21455;CzXICdEaWaY;CzXICdEaWaY-8-rgb_front;CzXICdEaWaY_11;CzXICdEaWaY_11-8-rgb_front;90.63;98.91;You are going to hear air start to being introduced into the milk, and what you are doing is creating foam at that point.;8;24
21456;CzXICdEaWaY;CzXICdEaWaY-8-rgb_front;CzXICdEaWaY_12;CzXICdEaWaY_12-8-rgb_front;100.07;106.02;And with breve, since it contains more fat, we are going to want to stretch it for longer.;8;18
21457;CzXICdEaWaY;CzXICdEaWaY-8-rgb_front;CzXICdEaWaY_13;CzXICdEaWaY_13-8-rgb_front;106.02;121.55;So, for breve latte, I am going to be stretching for about seven or eight seconds and then I am going to push this pitcher back up and get it at the right angle again so that it is spinning around inside the pitcher again and keep that up until it is at the temperature that I want the milk.;8;60
21458;CzXICdEaWaY;CzXICdEaWaY-8-rgb_front;CzXICdEaWaY_2;CzXICdEaWaY_2-8-rgb_front;21.42;35.88;So, I am going to mix that, just equal portions, half whole milk and half heavy whipping cream, which is going to make half and half or breve.;8;28
21459;CzXICdEaWaY;CzXICdEaWaY-8-rgb_front;CzXICdEaWaY_3;CzXICdEaWaY_3-8-rgb_front;37.35;41.67;And I am going to fill that up in the pitcher.;8;11
21460;CzXICdEaWaY;CzXICdEaWaY-8-rgb_front;CzXICdEaWaY_4;CzXICdEaWaY_4-8-rgb_front;41.67;48.27;I am using a 14-ounce cup, so I am going to fill up the milk to the pitcher to about this ridge.;8;22
21461;CzXICdEaWaY;CzXICdEaWaY-8-rgb_front;CzXICdEaWaY_5;CzXICdEaWaY_5-8-rgb_front;48.27;51.23;This is how much milk you should use.;8;8
21462;CzXICdEaWaY;CzXICdEaWaY-8-rgb_front;CzXICdEaWaY_6;CzXICdEaWaY_6-8-rgb_front;51.23;53.77;I am going to begin the steaming process.;8;8
21463;CzXICdEaWaY;CzXICdEaWaY-8-rgb_front;CzXICdEaWaY_7;CzXICdEaWaY_7-8-rgb_front;53.77;58.1;What I do is I do the steaming in three motions.;8;11
21464;CzXICdEaWaY;CzXICdEaWaY-8-rgb_front;CzXICdEaWaY_8;CzXICdEaWaY_8-8-rgb_front;58.1;71.57;The first is positioning the pitcher around the steam wand, in such a way--at an angle to where when you turn the steam wand on, the milk starts swirling around in a circle inside the steaming pitcher.;8;37
21465;CzXICdEaWaY;CzXICdEaWaY-8-rgb_front;CzXICdEaWaY_9;CzXICdEaWaY_9-8-rgb_front;71.57;81.05;I do that until the milk temperature kind of matches the temperature of my hand, it is about 100 degrees, and you just kind of feel this warm break in the milk.;8;32

21529;D1KcyG3ZgdM;D1KcyG3ZgdM-8-rgb_front;D1KcyG3ZgdM_1;D1KcyG3ZgdM_1-8-rgb_front;7.73;10.74;That's the major reason why people want to color their hair.;8;11

21536;D1KcyG3ZgdM;D1KcyG3ZgdM-8-rgb_front;D1KcyG3ZgdM_16;D1KcyG3ZgdM_16-8-rgb_front;71.91;78.77;It's going to wash out and just give you some strange orange and pink highlights.;8;15

21538;D1KcyG3ZgdM;D1KcyG3ZgdM-8-rgb_front;D1KcyG3ZgdM_2;D1KcyG3ZgdM_2-8-rgb_front;11.34;15.17;You have to do your homework again on this because all colors are not created equal.;8;16

21625;D9OtAUV9AJY;D9OtAUV9AJY-8-rgb_front;D9OtAUV9AJY_7;D9OtAUV9AJY_7-8-rgb_front;34.58;40.83;Now, the trick is, you don't want to put in too much olive juice, cause, if you wanted that you would just be drinking the olive juice.;8;27
21626;D9OtAUV9AJY;D9OtAUV9AJY-8-rgb_front;D9OtAUV9AJY_8;D9OtAUV9AJY_8-8-rgb_front;41.55;50.22;Second, you get yourself a good vodka, over ice, a good shake to it, and a martini glass.;8;18

21628;D9fI-2txDwo;D9fI-2txDwo-8-rgb_front;D9fI-2txDwo_0;D9fI-2txDwo_0-8-rgb_front;3.09;4.9;Letâs talk a little bit about throw ropes.;8;8
21629;D9fI-2txDwo;D9fI-2txDwo-8-rgb_front;D9fI-2txDwo_1;D9fI-2txDwo_1-8-rgb_front;4.96;22.94;We have a variety of different size throw ropes, this is a small throw rope here, has about a forty foot rope, pretty thin rope here, clips open, you can see that the ropes inside here.;8;36
21630;D9fI-2txDwo;D9fI-2txDwo-8-rgb_front;D9fI-2txDwo_2;D9fI-2txDwo_2-8-rgb_front;24.73;35.42;We have a throw rope thatâs attached to your waist so you know exactly where it is at all times.;8;20
21631;D9fI-2txDwo;D9fI-2txDwo-8-rgb_front;D9fI-2txDwo_3;D9fI-2txDwo_3-8-rgb_front;36.87;50.24;This again sort of a shortish rope, around forty feet, good for throwing ropes for short swims, people a short distance away and then this is more of a typical rafting throw rope.;8;33
21632;D9fI-2txDwo;D9fI-2txDwo-8-rgb_front;D9fI-2txDwo_4;D9fI-2txDwo_4-8-rgb_front;50.59;56.01;Itâs about a seventy-five foot rope, essentially the same design.;8;10
21633;D9fI-2txDwo;D9fI-2txDwo-8-rgb_front;D9fI-2txDwo_5;D9fI-2txDwo_5-8-rgb_front;56.98;68.8;When this comes new to you, itâs neatly wrapped inside the bag, you need to take it out and throw it once to get all that neatness out of it and then when you repack this rope.;8;37
21634;D9fI-2txDwo;D9fI-2txDwo-8-rgb_front;D9fI-2txDwo_6;D9fI-2txDwo_6-8-rgb_front;68.98;82.55;You pack it in a random way just stuffing the rope inside the bag and that way it enables it to, enables you to throw the rope, and the rope in the bag just feeds themselves out nicely which is great.;8;41
21666;DBDddxX-CJA;DBDddxX-CJA-8-rgb_front;DBDddxX-CJA_0;DBDddxX-CJA_0-8-rgb_front;0.23;14.59;As I said before bags were put into the game, were added to the game in the late 1960's because, this feature was to help to ratchet down, I guess you could ratchet up too, That's an interesting word.;8;39
21667;DBDddxX-CJA;DBDddxX-CJA-8-rgb_front;DBDddxX-CJA_1;DBDddxX-CJA_1-8-rgb_front;15.74;22.83;The use of the bidding by the old classic spaders who decided that well, maybe the partners had to bid a minimum of two.;8;24
21668;DBDddxX-CJA;DBDddxX-CJA-8-rgb_front;DBDddxX-CJA_10;DBDddxX-CJA_10-8-rgb_front;59.92;68.68;In spades the bag feature was added to add a dimension to the game where bagging does become a key part of the game.;8;24
21669;DBDddxX-CJA;DBDddxX-CJA-8-rgb_front;DBDddxX-CJA_11;DBDddxX-CJA_11-8-rgb_front;68.68;78.22;The great players really know how to utilize the bagging strategy, and the idea is to try to force the opponents into the penalty situation for underbidding the hands.;8;29
21670;DBDddxX-CJA;DBDddxX-CJA-8-rgb_front;DBDddxX-CJA_12;DBDddxX-CJA_12-8-rgb_front;79.16;83.54;There is a fine line between over bidding and under bidding and it's called the eleven bid.;8;17
21671;DBDddxX-CJA;DBDddxX-CJA-8-rgb_front;DBDddxX-CJA_13;DBDddxX-CJA_13-8-rgb_front;83.87;90.54;You know that when the hand is bid at eleven, you have to make a decision, are you going to go for the set, or are you going to go for the bags?;8;33
21672;DBDddxX-CJA;DBDddxX-CJA-8-rgb_front;DBDddxX-CJA_14;DBDddxX-CJA_14-8-rgb_front;91.61;98.76;It's tough to beat a trick, I mean if you have a suit that looks like queen, eight, and a really small one six.;8;24
21673;DBDddxX-CJA;DBDddxX-CJA-8-rgb_front;DBDddxX-CJA_15;DBDddxX-CJA_15-8-rgb_front;99.11;100.91;Can you really bid that for a trick?;8;8
21674;DBDddxX-CJA;DBDddxX-CJA-8-rgb_front;DBDddxX-CJA_16;DBDddxX-CJA_16-8-rgb_front;101.42;104.56;Well, if it was spades, probably.;8;6
21675;DBDddxX-CJA;DBDddxX-CJA-8-rgb_front;DBDddxX-CJA_17;DBDddxX-CJA_17-8-rgb_front;104.83;109.72;If it was hearts and so forth, but there's often times where you'd be forced to take a trick from that hand.;8;22
21676;DBDddxX-CJA;DBDddxX-CJA-8-rgb_front;DBDddxX-CJA_18;DBDddxX-CJA_18-8-rgb_front;110.05;123.35;And, a lot of the good players, what they do is that if they're forced to take this queen earlier then they say okay I took a trick I wasn't counting on and maybe if I can take another one that I'm not counting on and there's an eleven bid on the table, perhaps I can go for a set.;8;60
21677;DBDddxX-CJA;DBDddxX-CJA-8-rgb_front;DBDddxX-CJA_19;DBDddxX-CJA_19-8-rgb_front;123.86;135.55;So again, keep in mind that bagging is part of the game and the accumulation of over tricks will result in penalties, but it's like losing one-hundred points.;8;28
21678;DBDddxX-CJA;DBDddxX-CJA-8-rgb_front;DBDddxX-CJA_2;DBDddxX-CJA_2-8-rgb_front;22.83;26.09;So you get these eight and nine bids and who cares if you make over tricks.;8;16
21679;DBDddxX-CJA;DBDddxX-CJA-8-rgb_front;DBDddxX-CJA_20;DBDddxX-CJA_20-8-rgb_front;135.85;141.2;But then again if you over bid then you wind up getting into set situations.;8;15
21680;DBDddxX-CJA;DBDddxX-CJA-8-rgb_front;DBDddxX-CJA_21;DBDddxX-CJA_21-8-rgb_front;141.46;150.54;When we look at the advance side of this particular topic we will see the impact on bags and how the strategy of bagging really takes a big role in the end game of spades.;8;35
21681;DBDddxX-CJA;DBDddxX-CJA-8-rgb_front;DBDddxX-CJA_22;DBDddxX-CJA_22-8-rgb_front;150.94;154.25;Again, conservative but not too conservative.;8;6

21683;DBDddxX-CJA;DBDddxX-CJA-8-rgb_front;DBDddxX-CJA_3;DBDddxX-CJA_3-8-rgb_front;26.45;29.06;In other words, you didn't have to bid accurately.;8;9
21684;DBDddxX-CJA;DBDddxX-CJA-8-rgb_front;DBDddxX-CJA_4;DBDddxX-CJA_4-8-rgb_front;29.25;34.38;Some variations in the game even allowed people to bid three and if they made five, they got credit for five.;8;21

22134;DV9TmqoYQiU;DV9TmqoYQiU-8-rgb_front;DV9TmqoYQiU_11;DV9TmqoYQiU_11-8-rgb_front;53.18;67.04;"If you have an real high vegetation area in the trees, to where the smoke can't build escape, the smoke will build up all on your campsite, and it will just be miserable for you and your other campers; having to breathe smoke and all that.";8;46

22136;DV9TmqoYQiU;DV9TmqoYQiU-8-rgb_front;DV9TmqoYQiU_13;DV9TmqoYQiU_13-8-rgb_front;71.05;74.68;Lastly, try and build your fire off the beaten path.;8;10
22137;DV9TmqoYQiU;DV9TmqoYQiU-8-rgb_front;DV9TmqoYQiU_14;DV9TmqoYQiU_14-8-rgb_front;75.21;85.79;This is so that you don't have it near paths of animals, other campers, because animals and stuff like that will be naturally drawn to your fire, and so you want to be off the beaten path from them.;8;39
22138;DV9TmqoYQiU;DV9TmqoYQiU-8-rgb_front;DV9TmqoYQiU_15;DV9TmqoYQiU_15-8-rgb_front;85.83;89.31;So look for animal tracks, and make sure you put it away from them.;8;14
22139;DV9TmqoYQiU;DV9TmqoYQiU-8-rgb_front;DV9TmqoYQiU_16;DV9TmqoYQiU_16-8-rgb_front;89.78;92.3;And this is how you select an area for building a fire.;8;12

22694;DxFIaxNaCZI;DxFIaxNaCZI-8-rgb_front;DxFIaxNaCZI_2;DxFIaxNaCZI_2-8-rgb_front;10.02;15.2;Now if you've centered your plant correctly and you've firmed the soil around the plant.;8;15

22698;DxFIaxNaCZI;DxFIaxNaCZI-8-rgb_front;DxFIaxNaCZI_23;DxFIaxNaCZI_23-8-rgb_front;81.85;83.07;Is use some rocks.;8;4
22699;DxFIaxNaCZI;DxFIaxNaCZI-8-rgb_front;DxFIaxNaCZI_24;DxFIaxNaCZI_24-8-rgb_front;83.2;86.89;And have a whole bunch of different types of rocks.;8;10
22700;DxFIaxNaCZI;DxFIaxNaCZI-8-rgb_front;DxFIaxNaCZI_25;DxFIaxNaCZI_25-8-rgb_front;86.95;89.48;Decorative rocks, large boulders.;8;4

22703;DxFIaxNaCZI;DxFIaxNaCZI-8-rgb_front;DxFIaxNaCZI_3;DxFIaxNaCZI_3-8-rgb_front;15.84;18.49;And your container is not too big for the plant.;8;10
22704;DxFIaxNaCZI;DxFIaxNaCZI-8-rgb_front;DxFIaxNaCZI_31;DxFIaxNaCZI_31-8-rgb_front;101.23;104.21;Rocks are great because they add weight to the plant.;8;10

22706;DxFIaxNaCZI;DxFIaxNaCZI-8-rgb_front;DxFIaxNaCZI_33;DxFIaxNaCZI_33-8-rgb_front;109.86;113.24;Also they apply pressure to the roots.;8;7

22713;DxFIaxNaCZI;DxFIaxNaCZI-8-rgb_front;DxFIaxNaCZI_4;DxFIaxNaCZI_4-8-rgb_front;19.14;23.57;Hopefully, you shouldn't have too many problems with your plant being unstable.;8;12

22724;DxFIaxNaCZI;DxFIaxNaCZI-8-rgb_front;DxFIaxNaCZI_5;DxFIaxNaCZI_5-8-rgb_front;24.29;27.57;But there are circumstances and there are types of plants.;8;10

23734;ElkLut10fCQ;ElkLut10fCQ-8-rgb_front;ElkLut10fCQ_4;ElkLut10fCQ_4-8-rgb_front;23.02;33.06;The other thing I want to stress is: don't think you need to spend ten or fifteen minutes at a time on one bag, just hitting that same bag over and over again.;8;33
23735;ElkLut10fCQ;ElkLut10fCQ-8-rgb_front;ElkLut10fCQ_5;ElkLut10fCQ_5-8-rgb_front;33.4;38.18;What I like to see is approximately nine rounds per night on the heavy bag.;8;15

23737;ElkLut10fCQ;ElkLut10fCQ-8-rgb_front;ElkLut10fCQ_7;ElkLut10fCQ_7-8-rgb_front;50.3;57.88;This time concentrating on power, maybe using a heavier bag.;8;10

23739;ElkLut10fCQ;ElkLut10fCQ-8-rgb_front;ElkLut10fCQ_9;ElkLut10fCQ_9-8-rgb_front;62.6;65.61;And then, go do something else, double-end bag maybe.;8;9

23766;EmmuWoCUgXs;EmmuWoCUgXs-8-rgb_front;EmmuWoCUgXs_0;EmmuWoCUgXs_0-8-rgb_front;0.78;5.22;My name is Anthony Maddaloni, and I'm going to be talking about how to start a photography business.;8;18
23767;EmmuWoCUgXs;EmmuWoCUgXs-8-rgb_front;EmmuWoCUgXs_1;EmmuWoCUgXs_1-8-rgb_front;5.79;13.04;Now one thing about starting a photography business is that you want to really, seriously consider what you're doing.;8;19
23768;EmmuWoCUgXs;EmmuWoCUgXs-8-rgb_front;EmmuWoCUgXs_10;EmmuWoCUgXs_10-8-rgb_front;76.65;92.39;But if there's a way that you can make them minimal, such as buying equipment that maybe has been used, or equipment that is on sale because newer technologies have come out, but you could still use that type of equipment for the genre of photography business that you start.;8;50
23769;EmmuWoCUgXs;EmmuWoCUgXs-8-rgb_front;EmmuWoCUgXs_11;EmmuWoCUgXs_11-8-rgb_front;93.31;95.35;So those are some aspects that you want to look at it.;8;12
23770;EmmuWoCUgXs;EmmuWoCUgXs-8-rgb_front;EmmuWoCUgXs_12;EmmuWoCUgXs_12-8-rgb_front;95.74;104.73;I really frown upon going out and spending a large amount of money on the biggest and the best new equipment to start a business that you've never done before.;8;30
23771;EmmuWoCUgXs;EmmuWoCUgXs-8-rgb_front;EmmuWoCUgXs_13;EmmuWoCUgXs_13-8-rgb_front;105.29;108.76;I can, I can't think of a bigger mistake a person can potentially make.;8;14

23773;EmmuWoCUgXs;EmmuWoCUgXs-8-rgb_front;EmmuWoCUgXs_15;EmmuWoCUgXs_15-8-rgb_front;126.87;129.92;And this goes for any type of photography.;8;8

23776;EmmuWoCUgXs;EmmuWoCUgXs-8-rgb_front;EmmuWoCUgXs_18;EmmuWoCUgXs_18-8-rgb_front;162.76;170.36;People are going to go to you when you're the only person that does certain type of events, or photographs, let's say it's dancing.;8;24

23778;EmmuWoCUgXs;EmmuWoCUgXs-8-rgb_front;EmmuWoCUgXs_2;EmmuWoCUgXs_2-8-rgb_front;14.24;19.63;Most people start out in photography as a hobby or something they really enjoy.;8;14

23782;EmmuWoCUgXs;EmmuWoCUgXs-8-rgb_front;EmmuWoCUgXs_3;EmmuWoCUgXs_3-8-rgb_front;20.43;25.21;Now this is sort of, I don't know, being a little, you know, you really want to look at it.;8;20
23783;EmmuWoCUgXs;EmmuWoCUgXs-8-rgb_front;EmmuWoCUgXs_4;EmmuWoCUgXs_4-8-rgb_front;25.21;36.81;Do I want to start doing something I really enjoy as a pass time and start it in to a business, because you might not really enjoy doing it so much anymore where it becomes a business.;8;37
23784;EmmuWoCUgXs;EmmuWoCUgXs-8-rgb_front;EmmuWoCUgXs_5;EmmuWoCUgXs_5-8-rgb_front;37.32;44.17;But, on the other hand, you might actually enjoy doing it more because you're getting paid to do something you enjoy.;8;21
23785;EmmuWoCUgXs;EmmuWoCUgXs-8-rgb_front;EmmuWoCUgXs_6;EmmuWoCUgXs_6-8-rgb_front;44.61;54.08;I mean, I'm trying to kind of make it a little bit comical, but to be really honest with you, it really gets to be that way sometimes for some photographers.;8;31
23786;EmmuWoCUgXs;EmmuWoCUgXs-8-rgb_front;EmmuWoCUgXs_7;EmmuWoCUgXs_7-8-rgb_front;54.54;62.84;Where as they started out doing something they love and ended up actually hating it and just doing it for money, and in the end, I think sometimes that really shows.;8;31
23787;EmmuWoCUgXs;EmmuWoCUgXs-8-rgb_front;EmmuWoCUgXs_8;EmmuWoCUgXs_8-8-rgb_front;63.2;67.05;So it's really something you want to think about, even before you begin doing anything.;8;15
23788;EmmuWoCUgXs;EmmuWoCUgXs-8-rgb_front;EmmuWoCUgXs_9;EmmuWoCUgXs_9-8-rgb_front;67.85;76.25;One thing about a photography business is that photography is extremely expensive, so your start up fees are going to be very high.;8;23

23803;EmxarfGOKd0;EmxarfGOKd0-8-rgb_front;EmxarfGOKd0_21;EmxarfGOKd0_21-8-rgb_front;152.42;156.13;So carefully examine the body and make sure you don't see any little bugs.;8;14
23804;EmxarfGOKd0;EmxarfGOKd0-8-rgb_front;EmxarfGOKd0_22;EmxarfGOKd0_22-8-rgb_front;157.03;160.07;Look carefully between the toes and in the folds of the skin.;8;12

23808;EmxarfGOKd0;EmxarfGOKd0-8-rgb_front;EmxarfGOKd0_26;EmxarfGOKd0_26-8-rgb_front;184.72;192.39;Now addition to becoming inactive and losing weigh, if your leopard gecko is unable to shed, it may also develop eye problems.;8;22

23814;EmxarfGOKd0;EmxarfGOKd0-8-rgb_front;EmxarfGOKd0_31;EmxarfGOKd0_31-8-rgb_front;226.57;233.1;Not necessarily the type that gets the redness out of your eyes, but you want to make sure you get specifically eye lubricant.;8;23

24475;FaDSFhcBlHI;FaDSFhcBlHI-8-rgb_front;FaDSFhcBlHI_3;FaDSFhcBlHI_3-8-rgb_front;12.71;19.53;This is a really old staple of restaurant magic, usually it's done with paper matches.;8;15
24476;FaDSFhcBlHI;FaDSFhcBlHI-8-rgb_front;FaDSFhcBlHI_4;FaDSFhcBlHI_4-8-rgb_front;21.03;30.08;I took it a kind of step further and carved up a wooden match so it resembles a burnt match, because as the match burns it eats away at the wood.;8;31
24477;FaDSFhcBlHI;FaDSFhcBlHI-8-rgb_front;FaDSFhcBlHI_5;FaDSFhcBlHI_5-8-rgb_front;30.73;51.89;So we want to emulate that by carving the corners of the matchstick away, so starting at the head of the match just carve downwards about a quarter away down the matchstick until you have a kind of a shape that looks like a burnt match.;8;46
24478;FaDSFhcBlHI;FaDSFhcBlHI-8-rgb_front;FaDSFhcBlHI_6;FaDSFhcBlHI_6-8-rgb_front;52.71;61.29;Then take the marker and color the head of the matchstick and most of what you carved.;8;17
24479;FaDSFhcBlHI;FaDSFhcBlHI-8-rgb_front;FaDSFhcBlHI_7;FaDSFhcBlHI_7-8-rgb_front;61.35;71.43;See because it's now rough and uneven the color isn't going straight down, it's kind of just grabbing corners and edges of the stick.;8;24
24480;FaDSFhcBlHI;FaDSFhcBlHI-8-rgb_front;FaDSFhcBlHI_8;FaDSFhcBlHI_8-8-rgb_front;71.46;79.64;When you're done with that, you take your pretend burnt match, put it in the crutch of your thumb like this.;8;21
24481;FaDSFhcBlHI;FaDSFhcBlHI-8-rgb_front;FaDSFhcBlHI_9;FaDSFhcBlHI_9-8-rgb_front;80.55;91.36;Hold another match, strike the first match, make sure you get at least a quarter of it burnt, blow it out.;8;21

24485;FaTbGDrP9NI;FaTbGDrP9NI-8-rgb_front;FaTbGDrP9NI_11;FaTbGDrP9NI_11-8-rgb_front;69.01;76.3;This resulted in a product that was easy to transport and still very tasty once it got back to the mainland of Europe.;8;23

24525;FcWLrY8-XWs;FcWLrY8-XWs-8-rgb_front;FcWLrY8-XWs_1;FcWLrY8-XWs_1-8-rgb_front;5.36;12.43;I just want to add one thing, which is if your car's been sitting for a while, your oil is more than likely the old oil.;8;26
24526;FcWLrY8-XWs;FcWLrY8-XWs-8-rgb_front;FcWLrY8-XWs_10;FcWLrY8-XWs_10-8-rgb_front;57.43;64.5;So first step we're going to do towards changing the oil, is we're going to remove the oil cap on top of the engine.;8;24
24527;FcWLrY8-XWs;FcWLrY8-XWs-8-rgb_front;FcWLrY8-XWs_11;FcWLrY8-XWs_11-8-rgb_front;65.05;68.98;Now these can be you know any place on the car.;8;11
24528;FcWLrY8-XWs;FcWLrY8-XWs-8-rgb_front;FcWLrY8-XWs_12;FcWLrY8-XWs_12-8-rgb_front;69.21;72.8;Not any place, but more than likely closest to the engine.;8;11
24529;FcWLrY8-XWs;FcWLrY8-XWs-8-rgb_front;FcWLrY8-XWs_13;FcWLrY8-XWs_13-8-rgb_front;73.9;82.55;But like I said before with the dipstick, the engine oil for this car has a little graphic on it and also says engine oil which makes it a lot easier.;8;31
24530;FcWLrY8-XWs;FcWLrY8-XWs-8-rgb_front;FcWLrY8-XWs_14;FcWLrY8-XWs_14-8-rgb_front;82.94;85.71;So make sure you get the right cap that you screw off.;8;12
24531;FcWLrY8-XWs;FcWLrY8-XWs-8-rgb_front;FcWLrY8-XWs_15;FcWLrY8-XWs_15-8-rgb_front;85.71;92.15;But take this off, and that's going to help your oil flow a little bit smoother as you're taking it out of your car as well.;8;26
24532;FcWLrY8-XWs;FcWLrY8-XWs-8-rgb_front;FcWLrY8-XWs_2;FcWLrY8-XWs_2-8-rgb_front;12.43;18.72;That is more than likely kind of cold, kind of depends on the weather.;8;14
24533;FcWLrY8-XWs;FcWLrY8-XWs-8-rgb_front;FcWLrY8-XWs_3;FcWLrY8-XWs_3-8-rgb_front;18.72;24.85;But one thing you can do before you change the oil is you can go ahead and start your car up for a couple of minutes.;8;26
24534;FcWLrY8-XWs;FcWLrY8-XWs-8-rgb_front;FcWLrY8-XWs_4;FcWLrY8-XWs_4-8-rgb_front;26.07;31.8;Be careful with this though because if you start your car and leave it for too long, your car gets too hot.;8;22
24535;FcWLrY8-XWs;FcWLrY8-XWs-8-rgb_front;FcWLrY8-XWs_5;FcWLrY8-XWs_5-8-rgb_front;31.94;38.05;It's going to be really hot underneath when you're taking the oil out and when you're replacing the oil filter.;8;20
24536;FcWLrY8-XWs;FcWLrY8-XWs-8-rgb_front;FcWLrY8-XWs_6;FcWLrY8-XWs_6-8-rgb_front;38.45;44.42;So you want to be really careful with that, because you don't want to get burned on any of those hot parts underneath the car.;8;25
24537;FcWLrY8-XWs;FcWLrY8-XWs-8-rgb_front;FcWLrY8-XWs_7;FcWLrY8-XWs_7-8-rgb_front;44.86;45.84;So just a tip.;8;4

25160;a8QR93muFQ0;a8QR93muFQ0-8-rgb_front;a8QR93muFQ0_1;a8QR93muFQ0_1-8-rgb_front;5.14;6.31;There are several ways to do it.;8;7
25161;a8QR93muFQ0;a8QR93muFQ0-8-rgb_front;a8QR93muFQ0_10;a8QR93muFQ0_10-8-rgb_front;52.37;55.68;In other words a straightening shampoo and a straightening balm.;8;10
25162;a8QR93muFQ0;a8QR93muFQ0-8-rgb_front;a8QR93muFQ0_11;a8QR93muFQ0_11-8-rgb_front;56.03;59.06;What a straightening balm is going to do is it is actually going to coat the hair.;8;17
25163;a8QR93muFQ0;a8QR93muFQ0-8-rgb_front;a8QR93muFQ0_12;a8QR93muFQ0_12-8-rgb_front;59.06;67.84;They usually have silicones in them and that actually coats the hair shafts, fills up the holes if you will to prevent frizz and keep the humidity out.;8;28
25164;a8QR93muFQ0;a8QR93muFQ0-8-rgb_front;a8QR93muFQ0_13;a8QR93muFQ0_13-8-rgb_front;68.76;81.27;What a flat iron is going to do is it is actually going to go in and squish if you will really flatten out these cuticle layers so that way it gets that hair extremely straight and it will stay straight.;8;41
25165;a8QR93muFQ0;a8QR93muFQ0-8-rgb_front;a8QR93muFQ0_14;a8QR93muFQ0_14-8-rgb_front;81.51;89.53;The only problem with flat irons is a lot of times they are overused so when using a flat iron always make sure that you use some sort of heat protection.;8;31
25166;a8QR93muFQ0;a8QR93muFQ0-8-rgb_front;a8QR93muFQ0_15;a8QR93muFQ0_15-8-rgb_front;89.99;107.84;Either something you apply wet or dry prior to flat ironing in order to really protect that hair from that heat because that heat just directly on the hair shaft and it is basically like baking the hair so you just want to make sure that whichever one you choose, you always use some sort of protection on your hair.;8;60
25167;a8QR93muFQ0;a8QR93muFQ0-8-rgb_front;a8QR93muFQ0_2;a8QR93muFQ0_2-8-rgb_front;6.76;8.08;First there are chemicals.;8;4
25168;a8QR93muFQ0;a8QR93muFQ0-8-rgb_front;a8QR93muFQ0_3;a8QR93muFQ0_3-8-rgb_front;8.45;15.12;You can use a relaxer and apply it to the hair and it will chemically break down the bonds and straighten the curly hair.;8;24
25169;a8QR93muFQ0;a8QR93muFQ0-8-rgb_front;a8QR93muFQ0_4;a8QR93muFQ0_4-8-rgb_front;15.56;20.06;The other way is with a straightening balm and heat.;8;10
25170;a8QR93muFQ0;a8QR93muFQ0-8-rgb_front;a8QR93muFQ0_5;a8QR93muFQ0_5-8-rgb_front;20.4;27.58;Any type of heat and tension on the curly hair will actually pull it straight and another way, a third way is to use the flat iron.;8;27
25171;a8QR93muFQ0;a8QR93muFQ0-8-rgb_front;a8QR93muFQ0_6;a8QR93muFQ0_6-8-rgb_front;30.11;35.14;With the relaxer you just want to be sure that you don't double up on chemical services.;8;17

25184;a8zoNzPmXik;a8zoNzPmXik-8-rgb_front;a8zoNzPmXik_11;a8zoNzPmXik_11-8-rgb_front;83.67;87.12;It's a little four, flat, four pin plug.;8;8

25466;aHUC2fh-jfQ;aHUC2fh-jfQ-8-rgb_front;aHUC2fh-jfQ_19;aHUC2fh-jfQ_19-8-rgb_front;104.63;107.91;And we'll go ahead and then we'll do our thing for a couple of minutes and then we move on.;8;20
25467;aHUC2fh-jfQ;aHUC2fh-jfQ-8-rgb_front;aHUC2fh-jfQ_2;aHUC2fh-jfQ_2-8-rgb_front;16.54;20.25;So what you want to do is when you, usually people hire their photographers first.;8;15
25468;aHUC2fh-jfQ;aHUC2fh-jfQ-8-rgb_front;aHUC2fh-jfQ_20;aHUC2fh-jfQ_20-8-rgb_front;108.25;114.89;That's working well with a photographer and you want to make sure that your videographer works well with your photographer that way and doesn't try to take over everything.;8;29
25469;aHUC2fh-jfQ;aHUC2fh-jfQ-8-rgb_front;aHUC2fh-jfQ_21;aHUC2fh-jfQ_21-8-rgb_front;114.89;121.42;Because I know a lot of photographers that actually complain about the videographers that they've worked with because that's the how they are and they're always in their shots.;8;29
25470;aHUC2fh-jfQ;aHUC2fh-jfQ-8-rgb_front;aHUC2fh-jfQ_22;aHUC2fh-jfQ_22-8-rgb_front;121.42;125.88;And they're too bossy and they can't get in their shots.;8;11
25471;aHUC2fh-jfQ;aHUC2fh-jfQ-8-rgb_front;aHUC2fh-jfQ_23;aHUC2fh-jfQ_23-8-rgb_front;126.18;128.48;So it's very important to make sure that they work well together.;8;12
25472;aHUC2fh-jfQ;aHUC2fh-jfQ-8-rgb_front;aHUC2fh-jfQ_3;aHUC2fh-jfQ_3-8-rgb_front;20.54;22.54;Some people don't, some people go to the videographer first.;8;10

25480;aI092VEhmRU;aI092VEhmRU-8-rgb_front;aI092VEhmRU_1;aI092VEhmRU_1-8-rgb_front;6.25;10.39;But we want to touch on some of the fundamental tools of the trade and things that you need to know.;8;21
25481;aI092VEhmRU;aI092VEhmRU-8-rgb_front;aI092VEhmRU_10;aI092VEhmRU_10-8-rgb_front;71.61;76.78;And then your engine oil, which the filters visible on this side of the tractor, but it's very similar to this.;8;21
25482;aI092VEhmRU;aI092VEhmRU-8-rgb_front;aI092VEhmRU_11;aI092VEhmRU_11-8-rgb_front;77.16;88.79;Again you'll want to change that at least every one hundred hours with for this tractor a diesel grade engine oil, 15W40 is the most common grade.;8;27
25483;aI092VEhmRU;aI092VEhmRU-8-rgb_front;aI092VEhmRU_12;aI092VEhmRU_12-8-rgb_front;89.16;92.01;And the proper new filter.;8;5
25484;aI092VEhmRU;aI092VEhmRU-8-rgb_front;aI092VEhmRU_13;aI092VEhmRU_13-8-rgb_front;93.79;96.33;There's a lot more to it, but those are the fundamentals.;8;11
25485;aI092VEhmRU;aI092VEhmRU-8-rgb_front;aI092VEhmRU_14;aI092VEhmRU_14-8-rgb_front;96.33;101.56;On a diesel tractor they're much lower maintenance than a gasoline engine machine.;8;13
25486;aI092VEhmRU;aI092VEhmRU-8-rgb_front;aI092VEhmRU_15;aI092VEhmRU_15-8-rgb_front;101.99;112.1;And if you just keep those fluids and filters cleaned, keep all your pivot points lubricated, you're going a long way toward keeping your tractor in tip top shape.;8;29
25487;aI092VEhmRU;aI092VEhmRU-8-rgb_front;aI092VEhmRU_2;aI092VEhmRU_2-8-rgb_front;10.83;17.49;Socket wrench, grease gun, and then clean fluid and filters are very important.;8;13
25488;aI092VEhmRU;aI092VEhmRU-8-rgb_front;aI092VEhmRU_3;aI092VEhmRU_3-8-rgb_front;17.49;23.2;That's probably the single most important thing you can do on a diesel tractor is make sure you got clean fluid and filter.;8;23
25489;aI092VEhmRU;aI092VEhmRU-8-rgb_front;aI092VEhmRU_4;aI092VEhmRU_4-8-rgb_front;23.2;27.61;So here we've got an oil filter, air filter, and fuel filter.;8;12
25490;aI092VEhmRU;aI092VEhmRU-8-rgb_front;aI092VEhmRU_5;aI092VEhmRU_5-8-rgb_front;28.46;39.37;This will vary depending upon the tractor so refer to your manual or your dealer, but for our tractors we recommend changing these three filters and the fluid associated with them every hundred hours.;8;34
25491;aI092VEhmRU;aI092VEhmRU-8-rgb_front;aI092VEhmRU_6;aI092VEhmRU_6-8-rgb_front;39.56;40.43;One hundred hours.;8;3
25492;aI092VEhmRU;aI092VEhmRU-8-rgb_front;aI092VEhmRU_7;aI092VEhmRU_7-8-rgb_front;41.39;50.42;Your fuel filter you'll see is visible through this clear site glass it allows you to see any water or sediment that's getting trapped in the bowl here.;8;28
25493;aI092VEhmRU;aI092VEhmRU-8-rgb_front;aI092VEhmRU_8;aI092VEhmRU_8-8-rgb_front;52.27;64.53;Your air filter on this tractor is right here, that's something you may want to take out a lot more frequently than every one hundred hours, and blow it out if it's got some dust on it.;8;37
25494;aI092VEhmRU;aI092VEhmRU-8-rgb_front;aI092VEhmRU_9;aI092VEhmRU_9-8-rgb_front;64.53;70.54;But at least every one hundred hours or once a year you'll want to change that out for a clean filter.;8;21
25507;aKF1llwN-O8;aKF1llwN-O8-8-rgb_front;aKF1llwN-O8_0;aKF1llwN-O8_0-8-rgb_front;0.55;3.17;I am going to talk a little now about trail maintenance.;8;11
25508;aKF1llwN-O8;aKF1llwN-O8-8-rgb_front;aKF1llwN-O8_1;aKF1llwN-O8_1-8-rgb_front;3.31;5.67;This is a way that you can give back to the trail.;8;12
25509;aKF1llwN-O8;aKF1llwN-O8-8-rgb_front;aKF1llwN-O8_2;aKF1llwN-O8_2-8-rgb_front;6.48;10.04;It is not just people walking on the trail that makes that trail.;8;13
25510;aKF1llwN-O8;aKF1llwN-O8-8-rgb_front;aKF1llwN-O8_3;aKF1llwN-O8_3-8-rgb_front;10.04;26.6;There are people that have gone out and poured a lot of hard work and sweat into building the trails, to put down water bars to cut down on erosion, and cut up those logs that fall across the trail.;8;40
25511;aKF1llwN-O8;aKF1llwN-O8-8-rgb_front;aKF1llwN-O8_4;aKF1llwN-O8_4-8-rgb_front;27.24;49.02;There are clubs that actually go out and do maintenance on these trails, and it is a nice way to be social and hang out with other people who love the trail just like you and also make the trail a little bit nicer for the next persons that has got to hike through that section.;8;56
25512;aKF1llwN-O8;aKF1llwN-O8-8-rgb_front;aKF1llwN-O8_5;aKF1llwN-O8_5-8-rgb_front;49.07;61.63;It can be done at any capacity just from cutting down some weeds to something as elaborate as building a bridge across a creek or putting boards across some marshy areas.;8;31
25513;aKF1llwN-O8;aKF1llwN-O8-8-rgb_front;aKF1llwN-O8_6;aKF1llwN-O8_6-8-rgb_front;62.0;66.75;There is a lot that can be done, and it is a great way to give back to the trail.;8;20
25514;aKsbJ8peDKQ;aKsbJ8peDKQ-8-rgb_front;aKsbJ8peDKQ_0;aKsbJ8peDKQ_0-8-rgb_front;0.58;7.83;Hi this is John Stewart and this is how you can make and tie your own lasso trap for small animals with a shoe lace.;8;25
25515;aKsbJ8peDKQ;aKsbJ8peDKQ-8-rgb_front;aKsbJ8peDKQ_1;aKsbJ8peDKQ_1-8-rgb_front;7.97;15.98;Ok you're always going to have a shoe lace on you, if you are having to survive out in nature and look for food, easiest way to do it is to trap and kill it.;8;35
25516;aKsbJ8peDKQ;aKsbJ8peDKQ-8-rgb_front;aKsbJ8peDKQ_2;aKsbJ8peDKQ_2-8-rgb_front;16.23;19.51;Ok one way of doing this is the lasso trap.;8;10
25517;aKsbJ8peDKQ;aKsbJ8peDKQ-8-rgb_front;aKsbJ8peDKQ_3;aKsbJ8peDKQ_3-8-rgb_front;19.87;28.69;What you got to do for this is find a shoe lace find a tall, a branch or something that's low lying on the ground and find it near some animal tracks.;8;32
25518;aKsbJ8peDKQ;aKsbJ8peDKQ-8-rgb_front;aKsbJ8peDKQ_5;aKsbJ8peDKQ_5-8-rgb_front;40.4;49.52;The trap is very easy to make like I said have a shoe lace, you're going to have a couple of little branches that you can stick in the ground to prop up the loop, to where they can run through it.;8;42
25528;aNME-T1NzK8;aNME-T1NzK8-8-rgb_front;aNME-T1NzK8_0;aNME-T1NzK8_0-8-rgb_front;0.69;3.95;Okay, the closed stance is demonstrated here.;8;7
25529;aNME-T1NzK8;aNME-T1NzK8-8-rgb_front;aNME-T1NzK8_1;aNME-T1NzK8_1-8-rgb_front;4.03;13.75;We have this golf club here as being on line to my target, and then this club here is parallel to that line and that's where I keep my feet.;8;30
25530;aNME-T1NzK8;aNME-T1NzK8-8-rgb_front;aNME-T1NzK8_10;aNME-T1NzK8_10-8-rgb_front;60.84;65.56;It's a very nice shot, and it depends of course on what the lie of the green is.;8;18
25531;aNME-T1NzK8;aNME-T1NzK8-8-rgb_front;aNME-T1NzK8_11;aNME-T1NzK8_11-8-rgb_front;65.56;77.03;So the closed stance, you want to, you can practice, you can use yardsticks or golf clubs, or I've seen some people, they've built a little device so they can keep the club.;8;33
25532;aNME-T1NzK8;aNME-T1NzK8-8-rgb_front;aNME-T1NzK8_12;aNME-T1NzK8_12-8-rgb_front;77.03;84.86;They can stay closed and keep everything parallel, and that way they can keep their shots on line a lot better.;8;21
25533;aNME-T1NzK8;aNME-T1NzK8-8-rgb_front;aNME-T1NzK8_2;aNME-T1NzK8_2-8-rgb_front;13.78;20.92;So this is a closed stance and the goal here is I'm going to have the club somewhat closed or somewhat neutral.;8;22
25534;aNME-T1NzK8;aNME-T1NzK8-8-rgb_front;aNME-T1NzK8_3;aNME-T1NzK8_3-8-rgb_front;20.92;25.88;It's going to be perpendicular, or at a right angle to the line of the flight.;8;16
25535;aNME-T1NzK8;aNME-T1NzK8-8-rgb_front;aNME-T1NzK8_4;aNME-T1NzK8_4-8-rgb_front;26.21;34.98;So the goal here, with the closed stance is everything is in line and I just take the club back like this and I swing.;8;25
25536;aNME-T1NzK8;aNME-T1NzK8-8-rgb_front;aNME-T1NzK8_5;aNME-T1NzK8_5-8-rgb_front;34.98;38.09;So I just take it back and I hit that ball.;8;11
25537;aNME-T1NzK8;aNME-T1NzK8-8-rgb_front;aNME-T1NzK8_6;aNME-T1NzK8_6-8-rgb_front;38.44;52.44;So the idea of a closed stance, it's a way of I can put more true backspin on the ball, possible a little side spin that will go to the left, so I can keep the ball on line.;8;39
25538;aNME-T1NzK8;aNME-T1NzK8-8-rgb_front;aNME-T1NzK8_7;aNME-T1NzK8_7-8-rgb_front;54.48;55.16;Just like that.;8;3
25539;aNME-T1NzK8;aNME-T1NzK8-8-rgb_front;aNME-T1NzK8_8;aNME-T1NzK8_8-8-rgb_front;55.16;57.65;So that ball stays really straight when I hit it.;8;10
25540;aNME-T1NzK8;aNME-T1NzK8-8-rgb_front;aNME-T1NzK8_9;aNME-T1NzK8_9-8-rgb_front;57.97;60.54;So a closed stance is very useful.;8;7

25884;ahki1p2lqPI;ahki1p2lqPI-8-rgb_front;ahki1p2lqPI_10;ahki1p2lqPI_10-8-rgb_front;120.28;141.47;I emphasize on both left and right, so if they took a kick with their left they will kick with their left first, and then when the ball comes back to them they will do that with their right that way they get into the habit of using both feet to work on every kind of techniques for kicking the soccer ball.;8;62
25885;ahki1p2lqPI;ahki1p2lqPI-8-rgb_front;ahki1p2lqPI_11;ahki1p2lqPI_11-8-rgb_front;141.87;165.37;So to summarize again, you want to hold the ball you want to watch your timing, timing as the ball comes down, you want to look at the ball so keep an eye good close eye on the ball that's very important and then the ball comes down, bounces before he takes a big bounce up you actually want to come forward kick the ball, and land with your kicking foot.;8;71
25886;ahki1p2lqPI;ahki1p2lqPI-8-rgb_front;ahki1p2lqPI_12;ahki1p2lqPI_12-8-rgb_front;166.53;172.79;So that's how you can do you can practice a Half-Volley and have fun with it while you are at the park with your friends.;8;25
25887;ahki1p2lqPI;ahki1p2lqPI-8-rgb_front;ahki1p2lqPI_2;ahki1p2lqPI_2-8-rgb_front;9.35;21.13;A Half-Volley is actually when the ball comes at you, it's about to touch the ground it actually touches the ground, and as soon as the ball does that you actually kick the ball.;8;34
25888;ahki1p2lqPI;ahki1p2lqPI-8-rgb_front;ahki1p2lqPI_3;ahki1p2lqPI_3-8-rgb_front;21.73;26.77;So it is important that as soon as the ball touches the ground that you watch the ball does it bounce up?;8;22
25889;ahki1p2lqPI;ahki1p2lqPI-8-rgb_front;ahki1p2lqPI_4;ahki1p2lqPI_4-8-rgb_front;27.02;32.12;Because then you will miss that ball and again you might look a little funny if you are out there with your friends.;8;23
25890;ahki1p2lqPI;ahki1p2lqPI-8-rgb_front;ahki1p2lqPI_5;ahki1p2lqPI_5-8-rgb_front;32.87;37.66;So, what are the proper body mechanics when you kick a Half-Volley?;8;12
25891;ahki1p2lqPI;ahki1p2lqPI-8-rgb_front;ahki1p2lqPI_6;ahki1p2lqPI_6-8-rgb_front;37.69;57.35;Well first you want to approach the ball at a slight angle, your supporting foot comes a little bit behind the foot about six inches away from the ball, your kicking foot is going to approach the ball pointing your toes down, locking the ankle, and you're going to be kicking the ball with your shoelace.;8;56
25892;ahki1p2lqPI;ahki1p2lqPI-8-rgb_front;ahki1p2lqPI_7;ahki1p2lqPI_7-8-rgb_front;59.09;78.87;With your shoulders going backwards, so the motion is or the idea is to actually lift the ball a little bit but not too much and you want to strike the ball right underneath with your toes pointing down, so you can either score a goal or send the ball to one of your teammates.;8;55
25893;ahki1p2lqPI;ahki1p2lqPI-8-rgb_front;ahki1p2lqPI_8;ahki1p2lqPI_8-8-rgb_front;80.09;97.25;A good way to practice a Half-Volley is actually to have two players face each other, you put them about ten yards apart from each other, you want the players to hold the ball on their hands so for this purposes we're going to use one ball only.;8;48
25894;ahki1p2lqPI;ahki1p2lqPI-8-rgb_front;ahki1p2lqPI_9;ahki1p2lqPI_9-8-rgb_front;98.0;119.91;The player holds the ball, he drops the ball and as the ball touches the ground and tries to bounce up a little bit you want to kick the ball, in forward motion by landing with your kicking foot as soon as you have sent the ball to your teammate your teammate will catch the ball with his hands and you will repeat the exercise exactly the same way.;8;69

25921;alF9DejhzXM;alF9DejhzXM-8-rgb_front;alF9DejhzXM_3;alF9DejhzXM_3-8-rgb_front;22.6;33.51;We are going to start in table top position so go ahead and curl back down on to the mat supporting your head if you need to and bring your legs up into table top.;8;35

25924;alsOytcPxas;alsOytcPxas-8-rgb_front;alsOytcPxas_1;alsOytcPxas_1-8-rgb_front;4.7;12.25;If we're going to pair red wine with spicy food, you're probably talking about a nice, rich dish made with pork or maybe with beef.;8;25

25927;alsOytcPxas;alsOytcPxas-8-rgb_front;alsOytcPxas_2;alsOytcPxas_2-8-rgb_front;12.3;20.4;Maybe a blackened beef tenderloin, or maybe a chicken molet or a cumin crusted pork roast, or maybe a curry with beef.;8;22
25928;alsOytcPxas;alsOytcPxas-8-rgb_front;alsOytcPxas_3;alsOytcPxas_3-8-rgb_front;21.27;28.72;The best red wine pairings for these dishes are red wines with spice in them, some sort of a spicy flavor to them, in themselves.;8;25
25929;alsOytcPxas;alsOytcPxas-8-rgb_front;alsOytcPxas_4;alsOytcPxas_4-8-rgb_front;29.12;34.2;You also might want to stick with a wine that's got low tannin so that we don't have a salt and tannin clash.;8;23
25930;alsOytcPxas;alsOytcPxas-8-rgb_front;alsOytcPxas_5;alsOytcPxas_5-8-rgb_front;34.75;42.74;So, among the best red wines to pair with spicy foods, are the spicy red wines, like Zinfandel, especially one from California or from Lodine.;8;25
25931;alsOytcPxas;alsOytcPxas-8-rgb_front;alsOytcPxas_6;alsOytcPxas_6-8-rgb_front;43.33;45.39;Maybe a Malbec from Argentina.;8;5

26840;bSr7V1-5eUI;bSr7V1-5eUI-8-rgb_front;bSr7V1-5eUI_15;bSr7V1-5eUI_15-8-rgb_front;65.1;75.21;We can't very well keep fish that have different temperature requirements or different PH requirements together because we will be compromising the health of one species or another.;8;28

26850;bUM8cFhqG64;bUM8cFhqG64-8-rgb_front;bUM8cFhqG64_1;bUM8cFhqG64_1-8-rgb_front;9.51;25.16;If your cooking on the stove again your going to use 2 cups of rice for 2 cups of liquid but with the rice cooker because it holds in liquids so fully your going to use just 1 1/2 cup of rice for 1 cup of coconut milk, and 1 cup of water.;8;53
26851;bUM8cFhqG64;bUM8cFhqG64-8-rgb_front;bUM8cFhqG64_2;bUM8cFhqG64_2-8-rgb_front;26.16;55.24;So we've got our rice all nice and clean I add in just under a cup of water because again the rice cooker does keep the liquid in so fully, pour that in there, we'll pour in our 1 cup of coconut milk, because they'll be about an inch of liquid covering the rice.;8;54
26852;bUM8cFhqG64;bUM8cFhqG64-8-rgb_front;bUM8cFhqG64_3;bUM8cFhqG64_3-8-rgb_front;59.2;84.35;We'll through this in here I stir it a little bit since we're using 2 different kinds of liquid and very importantly you want to keep the lid on while the rice is cooking try to resist the temptation to open it up and see how's it doing.;8;48
26853;bUM8cFhqG64;bUM8cFhqG64-8-rgb_front;bUM8cFhqG64_4;bUM8cFhqG64_4-8-rgb_front;85.34;91.86;Flip down the lid and about 20 minutes you'll have some really sweet fragrant delicious rice to go with your stir fry.;8;22

26855;bUZZ_dE8kbs;bUZZ_dE8kbs-8-rgb_front;bUZZ_dE8kbs_1;bUZZ_dE8kbs_1-8-rgb_front;8.49;22.01;So keep a keep score, say I'm going to play four times or six times, and my cumulative score, I'll remember that for the next time that I play this particular type of solitaire.;8;34
26856;bUZZ_dE8kbs;bUZZ_dE8kbs-8-rgb_front;bUZZ_dE8kbs_2;bUZZ_dE8kbs_2-8-rgb_front;23.08;41.13;In this case, the way I would keep score with this game is, I would add up the cards remaining on the tableau, and each one is worth one, so one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen.;8;44
26857;bUZZ_dE8kbs;bUZZ_dE8kbs-8-rgb_front;bUZZ_dE8kbs_3;bUZZ_dE8kbs_3-8-rgb_front;41.71;52.42;I have a score of fourteen, and I'm going to add that to what I'm left with on the next one, and so forth.;8;24
26858;bUZZ_dE8kbs;bUZZ_dE8kbs-8-rgb_front;bUZZ_dE8kbs_4;bUZZ_dE8kbs_4-8-rgb_front;52.87;61.7;The idea is to get a lower score, so if you do win a hand, and it's not that hard, give yourself a score of zero.;8;26
26859;bUZZ_dE8kbs;bUZZ_dE8kbs-8-rgb_front;bUZZ_dE8kbs_5;bUZZ_dE8kbs_5-8-rgb_front;62.09;70.67;So if you have a cumulative score of say seventy, next time, hope that you can get sixty after your four games.;8;22

26861;bUsxa-igAF0;bUsxa-igAF0-8-rgb_front;bUsxa-igAF0_1;bUsxa-igAF0_1-8-rgb_front;5.42;11.46;First we take some shredded coconut and we pour it in the blender.;8;13
26862;bUsxa-igAF0;bUsxa-igAF0-8-rgb_front;bUsxa-igAF0_10;bUsxa-igAF0_10-8-rgb_front;51.93;59.28;What we are going to do is weâre going separate the shredded part from the milky part.;8;17
26863;bUsxa-igAF0;bUsxa-igAF0-8-rgb_front;bUsxa-igAF0_11;bUsxa-igAF0_11-8-rgb_front;59.4;62.86;So we pour that one there, like so.;8;8
26864;bUsxa-igAF0;bUsxa-igAF0-8-rgb_front;bUsxa-igAF0_12;bUsxa-igAF0_12-8-rgb_front;68.35;72.08;Then we take the cheese cloth and we squeeze it.;8;10
26865;bUsxa-igAF0;bUsxa-igAF0-8-rgb_front;bUsxa-igAF0_13;bUsxa-igAF0_13-8-rgb_front;73.44;80.07;And you can see, there is quite a bit of white milky substance coming out here.;8;16
26866;bUsxa-igAF0;bUsxa-igAF0-8-rgb_front;bUsxa-igAF0_14;bUsxa-igAF0_14-8-rgb_front;81.3;83.93;And you keep squeezing and squeezing.;8;6
26867;bUsxa-igAF0;bUsxa-igAF0-8-rgb_front;bUsxa-igAF0_15;bUsxa-igAF0_15-8-rgb_front;85.02;89.49;The shredded coconut you can put in and make candies with.;8;11
26868;bUsxa-igAF0;bUsxa-igAF0-8-rgb_front;bUsxa-igAF0_16;bUsxa-igAF0_16-8-rgb_front;89.92;92.4;Because this shredded coconut is still good.;8;7
26869;bUsxa-igAF0;bUsxa-igAF0-8-rgb_front;bUsxa-igAF0_17;bUsxa-igAF0_17-8-rgb_front;92.6;98.02;And, in fact, if I wanted to, I could put this back in the blender again, do the same process all over again.;8;23
26870;bUsxa-igAF0;bUsxa-igAF0-8-rgb_front;bUsxa-igAF0_18;bUsxa-igAF0_18-8-rgb_front;98.24;106.98;And get a little bit more milk before I would be ready to take that shredded coconut and use it in some other ingredient to make possibly candies or cake.;8;30
26871;bUsxa-igAF0;bUsxa-igAF0-8-rgb_front;bUsxa-igAF0_19;bUsxa-igAF0_19-8-rgb_front;107.96;110.65;So that is how you make the good coconut milk.;8;10
26872;bUsxa-igAF0;bUsxa-igAF0-8-rgb_front;bUsxa-igAF0_2;bUsxa-igAF0_2-8-rgb_front;12.82;19.41;Then we take, usually you use two parts water to one part coconut.;8;13
26873;bUsxa-igAF0;bUsxa-igAF0-8-rgb_front;bUsxa-igAF0_3;bUsxa-igAF0_3-8-rgb_front;20.12;27.57;So we take some water, now of course, you want to use really spring water or some treated water.;8;19
26874;bUsxa-igAF0;bUsxa-igAF0-8-rgb_front;bUsxa-igAF0_4;bUsxa-igAF0_4-8-rgb_front;27.57;29.57;You don't want to use chlorinated water.;8;7

26876;bUsxa-igAF0;bUsxa-igAF0-8-rgb_front;bUsxa-igAF0_6;bUsxa-igAF0_6-8-rgb_front;34.61;37.62;Then we take the blender and we turn it on.;8;10
26877;bUsxa-igAF0;bUsxa-igAF0-8-rgb_front;bUsxa-igAF0_7;bUsxa-igAF0_7-8-rgb_front;40.36;41.95;Alright, it doesn't take very long.;8;6
26878;bUsxa-igAF0;bUsxa-igAF0-8-rgb_front;bUsxa-igAF0_8;bUsxa-igAF0_8-8-rgb_front;42.73;46.25;Now once we have done that, lets push this aside a little bit.;8;13
26879;bUsxa-igAF0;bUsxa-igAF0-8-rgb_front;bUsxa-igAF0_9;bUsxa-igAF0_9-8-rgb_front;47.54;51.93;We have a little measuring cup and some cheese cloth.;8;10
26894;bVR-LN22vWk;bVR-LN22vWk-8-rgb_front;bVR-LN22vWk_0;bVR-LN22vWk_0-8-rgb_front;3.1;4.5;My name is Abby Jones.;8;5

26896;bVR-LN22vWk;bVR-LN22vWk-8-rgb_front;bVR-LN22vWk_10;bVR-LN22vWk_10-8-rgb_front;73.49;77.19;And I don't need to find a permanent space for them here.;8;12

26899;bVR-LN22vWk;bVR-LN22vWk-8-rgb_front;bVR-LN22vWk_13;bVR-LN22vWk_13-8-rgb_front;82.42;86.83;That I don't, or taking away from the apartment.;8;9

26901;bVR-LN22vWk;bVR-LN22vWk-8-rgb_front;bVR-LN22vWk_2;bVR-LN22vWk_2-8-rgb_front;12.55;24.16;And so one of the things that I like to do is to keep an area in my new place, where I keep things that I'm going to give away or that I need to return to people.;8;38
26902;bVR-LN22vWk;bVR-LN22vWk-8-rgb_front;bVR-LN22vWk_3;bVR-LN22vWk_3-8-rgb_front;24.39;33.49;So as I've been unpacking things, I've run across things that I need to return to people or that I don't want anymore.;8;23
26903;bVR-LN22vWk;bVR-LN22vWk-8-rgb_front;bVR-LN22vWk_4;bVR-LN22vWk_4-8-rgb_front;33.85;41.94;And I'm putting them over here in this corner to help avoid clutter in the areas where I'm going to be putting things away.;8;24
26904;bVR-LN22vWk;bVR-LN22vWk-8-rgb_front;bVR-LN22vWk_5;bVR-LN22vWk_5-8-rgb_front;42.21;49.42;So for instance these, this tapestry and this pillow, I had at my old apartment, but I don't have space for it at this apartment.;8;25
26905;bVR-LN22vWk;bVR-LN22vWk-8-rgb_front;bVR-LN22vWk_6;bVR-LN22vWk_6-8-rgb_front;49.42;56.99;So, I'm going to be returning those to my parents who were lending that to me at my new apartment, I mean my old apartment.;8;25
26906;bVR-LN22vWk;bVR-LN22vWk-8-rgb_front;bVR-LN22vWk_7;bVR-LN22vWk_7-8-rgb_front;58.07;65.4;These tension rods I was using in windows at my old apartment, but I don't have the same space here.;8;20

26916;bVioRHqYVpU;bVioRHqYVpU-8-rgb_front;bVioRHqYVpU_8;bVioRHqYVpU_8-8-rgb_front;49.09;53.96;It's delicate and it really brews a very lighter cup of tea.;8;12

26945;bYiJSQI2Wzs;bYiJSQI2Wzs-8-rgb_front;bYiJSQI2Wzs_13;bYiJSQI2Wzs_13-8-rgb_front;108.19;121.66;You are measuring the thickness of the skin and you have what is called subcutaneous layer of fat underneath the skin and so you are just going to pinch different areas of the body and that's what we are looking at.;8;41
26946;bYiJSQI2Wzs;bYiJSQI2Wzs-8-rgb_front;bYiJSQI2Wzs_14;bYiJSQI2Wzs_14-8-rgb_front;121.66;133.65;So a popular measurement is a three site measurement so you are going to measure tricep, abs, and thighs and then you sum up those skin folds, you put it into a formula and that is how you calculate your body fat.;8;42
26947;bYiJSQI2Wzs;bYiJSQI2Wzs-8-rgb_front;bYiJSQI2Wzs_2;bYiJSQI2Wzs_2-8-rgb_front;18.37;22.02;Many people ask what is a healthy body fat range?;8;10

27911;cC-MiIPH-14;cC-MiIPH-14-8-rgb_front;cC-MiIPH-14_1;cC-MiIPH-14_1-8-rgb_front;3.48;7.34;What we want to talk about right now is the importance of having a good rebounding team.;8;17
27912;cC-MiIPH-14;cC-MiIPH-14-8-rgb_front;cC-MiIPH-14_2;cC-MiIPH-14_2-8-rgb_front;7.82;20.26;Now, in the game of basketball, every possession counts and what a rebound means is another chance for your team to either score or less of a chance for the opposing team to get a chance to score.;8;38
27913;cC-MiIPH-14;cC-MiIPH-14-8-rgb_front;cC-MiIPH-14_3;cC-MiIPH-14_3-8-rgb_front;20.67;26.41;Rebounding is probably one of the most important parts, fundamental parts of the game of basketball.;8;16
27914;cC-MiIPH-14;cC-MiIPH-14-8-rgb_front;cC-MiIPH-14_4;cC-MiIPH-14_4-8-rgb_front;26.88;42.09;If you have a good rebounding team not only will your team get many chances at the basket but also the opposing team, every time they miss it and you get to rebound you'll be able to go to the other end and score, and that's what we all like to do is to go to the other end and score.;8;61
27915;cC-MiIPH-14;cC-MiIPH-14-8-rgb_front;cC-MiIPH-14_5;cC-MiIPH-14_5-8-rgb_front;42.39;63.8;So it's very important that each one of your players takes pride in rebounding and that you instill that in your practices and that you work on the fundamental skills of rebounding so that your team is able to get second chance shots and so that you can dominate inside and so that you can keep the other team off the boards and allow your team to score more.;8;69
27916;cC-MiIPH-14;cC-MiIPH-14-8-rgb_front;cC-MiIPH-14_6;cC-MiIPH-14_6-8-rgb_front;64.59;68.54;Really concentrate on rebounding, it will make your team much much better.;8;12

27960;cG6jFsMdpnw;cG6jFsMdpnw-8-rgb_front;cG6jFsMdpnw_1;cG6jFsMdpnw_1-8-rgb_front;3.27;5.75;This is called an eyebrow map.;8;6

27962;cG6jFsMdpnw;cG6jFsMdpnw-8-rgb_front;cG6jFsMdpnw_11;cG6jFsMdpnw_11-8-rgb_front;65.56;65.89;Ok.?;8;1

27964;cG6jFsMdpnw;cG6jFsMdpnw-8-rgb_front;cG6jFsMdpnw_13;cG6jFsMdpnw_13-8-rgb_front;77.8;89.35;When you're looking straight forward, where the pupil of your eye is, go ahead and open your eye, where the pupil of her eye is I want to hold this straight up above and that's where the highest part of her arch is going to be.;8;46
27965;cG6jFsMdpnw;cG6jFsMdpnw-8-rgb_front;cG6jFsMdpnw_14;cG6jFsMdpnw_14-8-rgb_front;89.96;94.28;So now I've created, that's all natural lines, no matter what your face shape is.;8;15
27966;cG6jFsMdpnw;cG6jFsMdpnw-8-rgb_front;cG6jFsMdpnw_15;cG6jFsMdpnw_15-8-rgb_front;94.59;97.72;So now I have actually created an eyebrow map.;8;9
27967;cG6jFsMdpnw;cG6jFsMdpnw-8-rgb_front;cG6jFsMdpnw_16;cG6jFsMdpnw_16-8-rgb_front;98.76;106.23;Now that I know the shape that I need to take I'm going to kind of embed this in my memory, in my brain, or if you need to remeasure as you go along that's fine.;8;36
27968;cG6jFsMdpnw;cG6jFsMdpnw-8-rgb_front;cG6jFsMdpnw_17;cG6jFsMdpnw_17-8-rgb_front;107.09;112.34;So now I know where the shape that I want her eyebrows to be.;8;14
27969;cG6jFsMdpnw;cG6jFsMdpnw-8-rgb_front;cG6jFsMdpnw_2;cG6jFsMdpnw_2-8-rgb_front;6.76;7.21;Ok.?;8;1

27972;cG6jFsMdpnw;cG6jFsMdpnw-8-rgb_front;cG6jFsMdpnw_5;cG6jFsMdpnw_5-8-rgb_front;11.44;26.86;First of all just take your stick or even your eyebrow brush, something with a straight line and what you want to do is measure from the inside of the nose, I mean, excuse me, the outside of the nose, hold the stick straight up.;8;45
27973;cG6jFsMdpnw;cG6jFsMdpnw-8-rgb_front;cG6jFsMdpnw_6;cG6jFsMdpnw_6-8-rgb_front;26.89;28.7;You're drawing imaginary lines, ok.?;8;5
27974;cG6jFsMdpnw;cG6jFsMdpnw-8-rgb_front;cG6jFsMdpnw_7;cG6jFsMdpnw_7-8-rgb_front;29.02;35.03;That's where the inside of her eyebrow is going to start, right here where this line is.;8;17
27975;cG6jFsMdpnw;cG6jFsMdpnw-8-rgb_front;cG6jFsMdpnw_8;cG6jFsMdpnw_8-8-rgb_front;35.46;39.38;That's the inside of her eyebrow, which is where it is naturally so that's good.;8;15
27976;cG6jFsMdpnw;cG6jFsMdpnw-8-rgb_front;cG6jFsMdpnw_9;cG6jFsMdpnw_9-8-rgb_front;39.78;52.09;Then you want to take the same space from her nose and draw an imaginary line again follow it to the outside corner of her eye and that's where the outside of her eyebrow will end.;8;36
27990;cH9SbtBbEEY;cH9SbtBbEEY-8-rgb_front;cH9SbtBbEEY_0;cH9SbtBbEEY_0-8-rgb_front;0.04;2.83;Hi I'm John Graden for the Martial Arts Teacher's Association.;8;10
27991;cH9SbtBbEEY;cH9SbtBbEEY-8-rgb_front;cH9SbtBbEEY_1;cH9SbtBbEEY_1-8-rgb_front;3.43;16.29;As a fighter and as a coach here are two offensive strategies that once you learn to understand that everything falls into place and quite simply it is a direct attack versus an indirect attack.;8;35
27992;cH9SbtBbEEY;cH9SbtBbEEY-8-rgb_front;cH9SbtBbEEY_10;cH9SbtBbEEY_10-8-rgb_front;72.46;77.92;If I go direct he is going to clock me as I come in and I don't want that to happen so I go about it indirectly.;8;27
27993;cH9SbtBbEEY;cH9SbtBbEEY-8-rgb_front;cH9SbtBbEEY_11;cH9SbtBbEEY_11-8-rgb_front;78.2;88.62;I'll throw a little fake on him, draw that punch out, and then finish the attack by stepping in the rest of the distance so it is an indirect attack.;8;30
27994;cH9SbtBbEEY;cH9SbtBbEEY-8-rgb_front;cH9SbtBbEEY_12;cH9SbtBbEEY_12-8-rgb_front;89.39;101.65;So a direct attack, nothing proceeds it and an indirect attack is usually proceeded by a fake or some kind of draw step or something that sets the attack up.;8;30
27995;cH9SbtBbEEY;cH9SbtBbEEY-8-rgb_front;cH9SbtBbEEY_13;cH9SbtBbEEY_13-8-rgb_front;102.38;110.94;You want to hit him with the punch or the kick but because of their counter fighting skills or speed or power you'll want to go about it indirectly.;8;29
27996;cH9SbtBbEEY;cH9SbtBbEEY-8-rgb_front;cH9SbtBbEEY_14;cH9SbtBbEEY_14-8-rgb_front;110.94;116.28;So become a master at direct attacks and indirect attacks and when to use each.;8;15
27997;cH9SbtBbEEY;cH9SbtBbEEY-8-rgb_front;cH9SbtBbEEY_15;cH9SbtBbEEY_15-8-rgb_front;116.64;117.33;I'm John Graden.;8;3

28004;cH9SbtBbEEY;cH9SbtBbEEY-8-rgb_front;cH9SbtBbEEY_6;cH9SbtBbEEY_6-8-rgb_front;42.74;55.09;That is fine, however, if he is bigger, stronger, faster, more experienced than me, stepping in with a direct attack could be kind of dangerous especially if he is a really good counter fighter.;8;34
28005;cH9SbtBbEEY;cH9SbtBbEEY-8-rgb_front;cH9SbtBbEEY_7;cH9SbtBbEEY_7-8-rgb_front;55.5;63.62;So I want to become a master of the indirect attack so possibly in this case I'm going to throw a little fake on him.;8;25
28006;cH9SbtBbEEY;cH9SbtBbEEY-8-rgb_front;cH9SbtBbEEY_8;cH9SbtBbEEY_8-8-rgb_front;63.65;68.52;In other words I'm going to hit him with this jab but I'm going to go about it indirectly.;8;19

28081;cOQgnuYJzyw;cOQgnuYJzyw-8-rgb_front;cOQgnuYJzyw_8;cOQgnuYJzyw_8-8-rgb_front;30.24;33.35;It's really important to learn how to call a cheer.;8;10
28082;cOQgnuYJzyw;cOQgnuYJzyw-8-rgb_front;cOQgnuYJzyw_9;cOQgnuYJzyw_9-8-rgb_front;33.87;40.42;The way we're going to call a cheer is to pick out the most prominent words and motions of the cheer.;8;21
28178;cRRD3k2ZGSc;cRRD3k2ZGSc-8-rgb_front;cRRD3k2ZGSc_0;cRRD3k2ZGSc_0-8-rgb_front;0.39;3.29;Hi I'm Tim Gipson and I'm going to talk to you about how to use steel wool.;8;17
28179;cRRD3k2ZGSc;cRRD3k2ZGSc-8-rgb_front;cRRD3k2ZGSc_1;cRRD3k2ZGSc_1-8-rgb_front;4.36;11.4;Now when we are using steel wool, steel wool comes in various coarseness and fineness.;8;15
28180;cRRD3k2ZGSc;cRRD3k2ZGSc-8-rgb_front;cRRD3k2ZGSc_2;cRRD3k2ZGSc_2-8-rgb_front;12.19;43.36;Now you have and they are graded by numbers so you may have a steel wool that is 2 or 3, any numbers like 1, 2, or 3 represent a coarse steel wool and that might be something that you use as far as removing rust from metal, using WD40 or an oil type of finish so if you have some rough machine parts that you want to clean up using a coarse steel wool.;8;75
28181;cRRD3k2ZGSc;cRRD3k2ZGSc-8-rgb_front;cRRD3k2ZGSc_3;cRRD3k2ZGSc_3-8-rgb_front;43.87;60.99;Then you get into the steel wools that are finer such as a 0 or a 00 or 000 and those are the type of steel wools that you use for something like this is when you are refinishing furniture or putting finishes on furniture.;8;45
28182;cRRD3k2ZGSc;cRRD3k2ZGSc-8-rgb_front;cRRD3k2ZGSc_4;cRRD3k2ZGSc_4-8-rgb_front;61.59;85.71;What the steel wool allows you to do is get a really smooth surface as opposed to using a fine sand paper so we'll use the steel wool so in this case if we have put a coat of varnish or urethane or a shellac on this and we are in between coats then we can use the steel wool.;8;60
28183;cRRD3k2ZGSc;cRRD3k2ZGSc-8-rgb_front;cRRD3k2ZGSc_5;cRRD3k2ZGSc_5-8-rgb_front;85.71;129.72;Now it is usually a good idea to have a neoprene or latex glove or a rubber glove that you are using when you are using steel wool because little shavings can come off and can embed in your skin so it is good to have some kind of protection but when we are using steel wool we are going to use it just like we would any sand paper and we are just going to rub it and we're going to go with the grain so it is very important when you are refinishing wood that you always use any type of sand paper or any type of steel wool you are putting very very fine scratches into the surface so you always want that to go with the grain so that it won't show up.;8;137
28184;cRRD3k2ZGSc;cRRD3k2ZGSc-8-rgb_front;cRRD3k2ZGSc_6;cRRD3k2ZGSc_6-8-rgb_front;131.07;151.03;So again it works just like using steel wool is just like using sand paper and we can just work back and forth and what it does is it really can give you a very fine surface in between your coats of your urethane, shellac or lacquer or polyurethanes.;8;49
28185;cRRD3k2ZGSc;cRRD3k2ZGSc-8-rgb_front;cRRD3k2ZGSc_7;cRRD3k2ZGSc_7-8-rgb_front;151.59;153.73;So I'm Tim Gipson and that's how to use steel wool.;8;11

28246;cVe-33JxCEo;cVe-33JxCEo-8-rgb_front;cVe-33JxCEo_11;cVe-33JxCEo_11-8-rgb_front;112.34;114.91;If you're doing gold, you're going to always want to stick with solid gold.;8;14
28247;cVe-33JxCEo;cVe-33JxCEo-8-rgb_front;cVe-33JxCEo_12;cVe-33JxCEo_12-8-rgb_front;115.54;126.2;If you don't like to stick with that standard theme, and you kind of want to get kooky with what you're doing,there' a lot of different turns on charms out there, that will bring a little color into your bracelet.;8;40
28248;cVe-33JxCEo;cVe-33JxCEo-8-rgb_front;cVe-33JxCEo_13;cVe-33JxCEo_13-8-rgb_front;126.51;130.59;You can look for enamel charms, that have been colored in with the glass enamel.;8;15
28249;cVe-33JxCEo;cVe-33JxCEo-8-rgb_front;cVe-33JxCEo_14;cVe-33JxCEo_14-8-rgb_front;130.95;140.07;You can also look for, and these are a little pricey, but jewels and gems inside charms, to kind of make the bracelet a little more upscale.;8;27
28250;cVe-33JxCEo;cVe-33JxCEo-8-rgb_front;cVe-33JxCEo_15;cVe-33JxCEo_15-8-rgb_front;141.0;179.87;I also wanted to talk about two other types of charm bracelets, that have kind of come up in popularity, with charm bracelets resurgence, and that's the European Charm Bracelet, which is really a combination of different types of silver, and jeweled beads, so it's definitely nothing like what we think of, as the American Charm Bracelet, and there's also the Italian Charm Bracelet, and these, you'll see a lot of different stores nowadays,and they're flat bracelets with charms kind of riveted into it, and it's connecting links, so that's how you get in the different little charms, is the links of the bracelet, so this has been how to choose a charm, for your charm bracelet.;8;117
28251;cVe-33JxCEo;cVe-33JxCEo-8-rgb_front;cVe-33JxCEo_2;cVe-33JxCEo_2-8-rgb_front;13.87;18.46;Actually, depending on how you're judging it, way, way far back.;8;11
28252;cVe-33JxCEo;cVe-33JxCEo-8-rgb_front;cVe-33JxCEo_3;cVe-33JxCEo_3-8-rgb_front;18.73;38.92;They were popularized as Catholic symbols, and tools to show your beliefs, and then they came back in the 50's as kind of kitschy little pieces, that teens collected, and each charm on bracelets in the 50's, would usually represent an important moment in a person's life.;8;47
28253;cVe-33JxCEo;cVe-33JxCEo-8-rgb_front;cVe-33JxCEo_4;cVe-33JxCEo_4-8-rgb_front;39.29;45.53;You'd have a 16th birthday one, you'd have a marriage one, you'd have a graduation one, so it's sort of like a story on a bracelet.;8;26
28254;cVe-33JxCEo;cVe-33JxCEo-8-rgb_front;cVe-33JxCEo_5;cVe-33JxCEo_5-8-rgb_front;45.53;62.19;It kind of fell out of fashion, during the 70's, when disco era, big chains, came in, but charm bracelets have made a recent resurgence, and that makes buying a charm, really easy right now, so there's a lot of places selling them.;8;43
28255;cVe-33JxCEo;cVe-33JxCEo-8-rgb_front;cVe-33JxCEo_6;cVe-33JxCEo_6-8-rgb_front;62.22;78.63;There's a lot of companies bringing it back,and the trade of vintage charms, has become really big, so when you're selecting charms for a charm bracelet, assuming you don't yet have your bracelet, it's something to think about, before you really get started collecting.;8;44
28256;cVe-33JxCEo;cVe-33JxCEo-8-rgb_front;cVe-33JxCEo_7;cVe-33JxCEo_7-8-rgb_front;78.73;82.37;When you get the bracelet, you sort of commit to a motif.;8;12
28257;cVe-33JxCEo;cVe-33JxCEo-8-rgb_front;cVe-33JxCEo_8;cVe-33JxCEo_8-8-rgb_front;82.37;85.6;If you're going to get a gold one, you kind of commit to gold.;8;14
28258;cVe-33JxCEo;cVe-33JxCEo-8-rgb_front;cVe-33JxCEo_9_10;cVe-33JxCEo_9_10-8-rgb_front;85.6;112.34;If you're going to get a silver one, you kind of commit to silver, colors, expense, sterling silver versus cheap. If you're going to want to keep a theme, with your whole bracelet, you're going to want to put some thought, when you're first buying it, into what color,what look for the long term, are you going to really want, so when you decide that theme, you're going to want to stick with a light metal, so if you're doing silver, you're going to always want to stick with sterling silver.;8;91
28290;cYTNoYFqyc0;cYTNoYFqyc0-8-rgb_front;cYTNoYFqyc0_0;cYTNoYFqyc0_0-8-rgb_front;0.92;3.65;Just to recap and summarize our grip.;8;7
28291;cYTNoYFqyc0;cYTNoYFqyc0-8-rgb_front;cYTNoYFqyc0_1;cYTNoYFqyc0_1-8-rgb_front;3.69;9.64;Remember you are going to grip the racket and you turn it like that so the racket faces open.;8;19
28292;cYTNoYFqyc0;cYTNoYFqyc0-8-rgb_front;cYTNoYFqyc0_10;cYTNoYFqyc0_10-8-rgb_front;54.06;64.39;If I have a bad grip I can hit all types of bad shots but if I have the proper grip I am going to be much more cognizant of staying away from the ball and hitting a good shot.;8;40
28293;cYTNoYFqyc0;cYTNoYFqyc0-8-rgb_front;cYTNoYFqyc0_11;cYTNoYFqyc0_11-8-rgb_front;64.63;91.68;So the idea of why the grip is such a simple concept but it is so overlooked because people are always looking for those big improvements but the fastest way to improve your game is to get a good grip so that once again it is that open face on both sides so you see how you open the face and if you do that you will be able to hit a nice loft on the ball and you will have a good shot so remember with an open face that is an easy shot.;8;95
28294;cYTNoYFqyc0;cYTNoYFqyc0-8-rgb_front;cYTNoYFqyc0_12;cYTNoYFqyc0_12-8-rgb_front;92.02;98.6;With a closed face it is no good so open the face and your game will be good.;8;18

28297;cYTNoYFqyc0;cYTNoYFqyc0-8-rgb_front;cYTNoYFqyc0_4;cYTNoYFqyc0_4-8-rgb_front;22.21;24.36;It is not like tennis where we hit top spin.;8;10

28300;cYTNoYFqyc0;cYTNoYFqyc0-8-rgb_front;cYTNoYFqyc0_7;cYTNoYFqyc0_7-8-rgb_front;38.87;42.61;If you have a good grip that is going to force you to move in certain ways.;8;17

28302;cYTNoYFqyc0;cYTNoYFqyc0-8-rgb_front;cYTNoYFqyc0_9;cYTNoYFqyc0_9-8-rgb_front;52.1;53.77;The same goes on the forehand.;8;6

28326;cZbKzFhPbsg;cZbKzFhPbsg-8-rgb_front;cZbKzFhPbsg_12;cZbKzFhPbsg_12-8-rgb_front;101.96;106.61;I know dentist that make as little as $120 and I tell you dentists that make as much as a million.;8;21

28328;cZbKzFhPbsg;cZbKzFhPbsg-8-rgb_front;cZbKzFhPbsg_14;cZbKzFhPbsg_14-8-rgb_front;117.55;127.86;It's definitely growing a recent statistic approximately a year or two ago has suggested that for every four dentist that were retiring only one dentist was entering into school.;8;29
28329;cZbKzFhPbsg;cZbKzFhPbsg-8-rgb_front;cZbKzFhPbsg_15;cZbKzFhPbsg_15-8-rgb_front;128.24;144.47;Which is an outstanding feature for some one who's pursuing the career of dentistry because there's a lot of dentist that are baby boomers and because of that the access to dental care is becoming decrease very rapidly so it's a great time for someone to pursue dentistry.;8;48
28330;cZbKzFhPbsg;cZbKzFhPbsg-8-rgb_front;cZbKzFhPbsg_2;cZbKzFhPbsg_2-8-rgb_front;14.29;23.7;This is what's called a dental hand piece or core drill and this is the device that's typically used to help remove the cavity or the filling out of a tooth to help us fix it.;8;36

28333;cZbKzFhPbsg;cZbKzFhPbsg-8-rgb_front;cZbKzFhPbsg_5;cZbKzFhPbsg_5-8-rgb_front;39.16;43.52;That again can be very variable because depends certainly on the location where your at.;8;15
28334;cZbKzFhPbsg;cZbKzFhPbsg-8-rgb_front;cZbKzFhPbsg_6;cZbKzFhPbsg_6-8-rgb_front;43.91;46.22;It also depends on how much you work.;8;8

28336;cZbKzFhPbsg;cZbKzFhPbsg-8-rgb_front;cZbKzFhPbsg_8;cZbKzFhPbsg_8-8-rgb_front;63.64;71.46;So there's a lot of variability you know, in the salary of a dentist depending upon where you are, who you're working for, and also how long you've been practicing.;8;30
28337;cZbKzFhPbsg;cZbKzFhPbsg-8-rgb_front;cZbKzFhPbsg_9;cZbKzFhPbsg_9-8-rgb_front;72.2;89.92;If you're going into like a residency so you want to get additional training, it may be starting as little as $50 or $60,000 or if you go directly into private practice which is what most people do when they graduate dental school they could start out for as much as probably I'd say as much as $100 to $120,000.;8;60

28717;cueklcakdUc;cueklcakdUc-8-rgb_front;cueklcakdUc_6;cueklcakdUc_6-8-rgb_front;46.51;50.06;So it's important to add water to this clay but not too much.;8;13

Another way you can do it is if you just have some tape and a brush, this tape here is low stick and it won't pull the paint that is existing on the wall off so you take a strip of it and pull it fairly tight and put it on the wall or the board or surface that you're going to paint.;8;74

29504;dnHhd661caQ;dnHhd661caQ-8-rgb_front;dnHhd661caQ_24;dnHhd661caQ_24-8-rgb_front;131.63;136.6;You can see how the colors have all come together and helped make you make a very special mural yourself.;8;20

29685;dwxB_OaeAAg;dwxB_OaeAAg-8-rgb_front;dwxB_OaeAAg_4;dwxB_OaeAAg_4-8-rgb_front;29.87;39.94;And oolong tea, it's also recommended with, you can use this because oolong tea imparts flavors of aroma of orchids and lilac and these teapots will absorb that.;8;28
29686;dwxB_OaeAAg;dwxB_OaeAAg-8-rgb_front;dwxB_OaeAAg_5;dwxB_OaeAAg_5-8-rgb_front;41.99;53.12;So, if you want to use the YiXing, you don't have to worry about using any filter, there's already a filter that's inside these teapots and the tea is put in.;8;31
29687;dwxB_OaeAAg;dwxB_OaeAAg-8-rgb_front;dwxB_OaeAAg_6;dwxB_OaeAAg_6-8-rgb_front;53.15;65.36;You put a concentrated amount, just because you're using so little water and you're infusing it only twenty seconds, thirty seconds at a time, so that your guest is constantly getting replenished with warm or hot tea.;8;37
29688;dwxB_OaeAAg;dwxB_OaeAAg-8-rgb_front;dwxB_OaeAAg_7;dwxB_OaeAAg_7-8-rgb_front;66.0;74.96;And you hold the YiXing teapots like this and there's a little hole at the center, when you put your finger in that hole, it stops the water from coming out.;8;31

29752;e5HYroYJ9pk;e5HYroYJ9pk-8-rgb_front;e5HYroYJ9pk_8;e5HYroYJ9pk_8-8-rgb_front;53.87;58.3;Some people will tell you right away that they have really good perception.;8;13
29753;e5HYroYJ9pk;e5HYroYJ9pk-8-rgb_front;e5HYroYJ9pk_9;e5HYroYJ9pk_9-8-rgb_front;58.3;69.2;They can really, they're really right about people when they first meet them and other people will say, oh I have terrible perception, I mean I always judge people wrong.;8;30
29762;e6kaamScxwY;e6kaamScxwY-8-rgb_front;e6kaamScxwY_0;e6kaamScxwY_0-8-rgb_front;0.1;3.93;Once your image is drawn on the paper, it's time to decorate it.;8;13
29763;e6kaamScxwY;e6kaamScxwY-8-rgb_front;e6kaamScxwY_1;e6kaamScxwY_1-8-rgb_front;4.47;12.37;Now it's very important when decorating, that you want to use a lot of color as I mentioned before, and these colors are really going to make the difference in your project.;8;32
29764;e6kaamScxwY;e6kaamScxwY-8-rgb_front;e6kaamScxwY_10;e6kaamScxwY_10-8-rgb_front;94.08;104.14;All of these things, when running projects for groups, are very important things that you have to really keep in mind and take an accounting for when planning the projects.;8;30
29765;e6kaamScxwY;e6kaamScxwY-8-rgb_front;e6kaamScxwY_11;e6kaamScxwY_11-8-rgb_front;104.14;106.6;So now we see our image is colored.;8;8
29766;e6kaamScxwY;e6kaamScxwY-8-rgb_front;e6kaamScxwY_12;e6kaamScxwY_12-8-rgb_front;106.6;115.88;We see we chose some bright paint colors, some paint markers with silver and gold colors, and also we made the image nice and big.;8;25
29767;e6kaamScxwY;e6kaamScxwY-8-rgb_front;e6kaamScxwY_13;e6kaamScxwY_13-8-rgb_front;115.88;123.27;Not with a lot of fine details because there's--when the folds are running down the paper, it's going to be hard to see any fine details.;8;26
29768;e6kaamScxwY;e6kaamScxwY-8-rgb_front;e6kaamScxwY_14;e6kaamScxwY_14-8-rgb_front;123.27;134.73;We just want to have some nice big image, and also you can notice how it takes up the full size of the paper, from left to right, and this is basically how you want to make your image.;8;39
29769;e6kaamScxwY;e6kaamScxwY-8-rgb_front;e6kaamScxwY_15;e6kaamScxwY_15-8-rgb_front;134.73;138.23;So we now completed the first image that's going to be part of our reversible picture.;8;16
29770;e6kaamScxwY;e6kaamScxwY-8-rgb_front;e6kaamScxwY_2;e6kaamScxwY_2-8-rgb_front;13.75;18.8;Together with making the colors, it's important to make the image should have some sort of outline around it.;8;19
29771;e6kaamScxwY;e6kaamScxwY-8-rgb_front;e6kaamScxwY_3;e6kaamScxwY_3-8-rgb_front;19.07;31.72;So there really is no right and wrong when decorating the image, but the most important thing to keep in mind is that you want it to really look flashy--bright colors and to make it really stand out.;8;38
29772;e6kaamScxwY;e6kaamScxwY-8-rgb_front;e6kaamScxwY_4;e6kaamScxwY_4-8-rgb_front;31.72;45.76;This decorating really becomes the main part of the project, so it's good to know when you're working with kids, that you should choose the supplies you're going to use--the colors and the way you decorate it--choose it carefully.;8;39
29773;e6kaamScxwY;e6kaamScxwY-8-rgb_front;e6kaamScxwY_5;e6kaamScxwY_5-8-rgb_front;45.76;51.99;You'll be under some time constraints, and also there are different children and different age groups have different abilities.;8;19
29774;e6kaamScxwY;e6kaamScxwY-8-rgb_front;e6kaamScxwY_6;e6kaamScxwY_6-8-rgb_front;51.99;61.97;Some of the kids find it easier to use glue and paint, and other kids find it easier just to draw freehand and apply colors right directly onto the paper.;8;30
29775;e6kaamScxwY;e6kaamScxwY-8-rgb_front;e6kaamScxwY_7;e6kaamScxwY_7-8-rgb_front;61.97;70.35;Now as far as getting the original image, you might want to get the image beforehand, and then all the kids have to do is just go ahead and decorate it with different colors.;8;34
29776;e6kaamScxwY;e6kaamScxwY-8-rgb_front;e6kaamScxwY_8;e6kaamScxwY_8-8-rgb_front;70.35;84.18;That makes things a lot easier and the kids feel more comfortable when they--when the finished product comes out to be something of more of a defined image, as opposed to something that they draw on paper, depending on the age group.;8;42
29777;e6kaamScxwY;e6kaamScxwY-8-rgb_front;e6kaamScxwY_9;e6kaamScxwY_9-8-rgb_front;84.18;94.08;So that's also something you might want to keep in mind, just to have a uniform image that is copied, and then just have them decorate it.;8;27
29798;e9UWZ3kkA7Y;e9UWZ3kkA7Y-8-rgb_front;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_0;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_0-8-rgb_front;0.52;5.19;Some people say the number one enemy to a fly fisher is wind.;8;13

29800;e9UWZ3kkA7Y;e9UWZ3kkA7Y-8-rgb_front;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_10;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_10-8-rgb_front;64.65;71.35;So, it's low, come up and make your regular conventional cast because essentially, the wind is going to carry it through.;8;21
29801;e9UWZ3kkA7Y;e9UWZ3kkA7Y-8-rgb_front;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_11;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_11-8-rgb_front;71.95;77.29;I'll demonstrate with my hand, lift, flip up, and make the cast.;8;12
29802;e9UWZ3kkA7Y;e9UWZ3kkA7Y-8-rgb_front;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_12;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_12-8-rgb_front;77.57;80.9;This is essentially called an elliptical or circular cast.;8;9
29803;e9UWZ3kkA7Y;e9UWZ3kkA7Y-8-rgb_front;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_13;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_13-8-rgb_front;81.77;83.73;See the elliptical motion of the hand?;8;7
29804;e9UWZ3kkA7Y;e9UWZ3kkA7Y-8-rgb_front;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_14;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_14-8-rgb_front;84.96;88.21;Underneath the wind, and stop and make your forward cast.;8;10
29805;e9UWZ3kkA7Y;e9UWZ3kkA7Y-8-rgb_front;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_15;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_15-8-rgb_front;88.21;89.26;Now, I'll demonstrate.;8;3
29806;e9UWZ3kkA7Y;e9UWZ3kkA7Y-8-rgb_front;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_16;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_16-8-rgb_front;90.96;93.95;Low, there's our cast.;8;4
29807;e9UWZ3kkA7Y;e9UWZ3kkA7Y-8-rgb_front;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_17;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_17-8-rgb_front;95.13;96.53;See how the rod goes low?;8;6
29808;e9UWZ3kkA7Y;e9UWZ3kkA7Y-8-rgb_front;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_18;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_18-8-rgb_front;97.14;98.49;And, we make our perfect stop.;8;6
29809;e9UWZ3kkA7Y;e9UWZ3kkA7Y-8-rgb_front;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_19;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_19-8-rgb_front;98.87;101.2;The wind is going to carry our forward cast.;8;9
29810;e9UWZ3kkA7Y;e9UWZ3kkA7Y-8-rgb_front;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_2;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_2-8-rgb_front;9.59;17.26;So, when the wind is coming towards you, you want to get underneath the wind, so now I will demonstrate that for you, o.k.;8;24
29811;e9UWZ3kkA7Y;e9UWZ3kkA7Y-8-rgb_front;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_20;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_20-8-rgb_front;104.63;111.67;So, it's, and that's how we are able to fish in all types of wind.;8;15
29812;e9UWZ3kkA7Y;e9UWZ3kkA7Y-8-rgb_front;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_21;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_21-8-rgb_front;111.71;113.75;You will be a good fly fisher.;8;7

29814;e9UWZ3kkA7Y;e9UWZ3kkA7Y-8-rgb_front;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_4;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_4-8-rgb_front;21.72;24.83;Up, now see how we get underneath.;8;7
29815;e9UWZ3kkA7Y;e9UWZ3kkA7Y-8-rgb_front;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_5;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_5-8-rgb_front;24.98;26.99;We go low to the ground.;8;6
29816;e9UWZ3kkA7Y;e9UWZ3kkA7Y-8-rgb_front;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_6;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_6-8-rgb_front;37.09;39.46;By doing that, we cut underneath the wind.;8;8
29817;e9UWZ3kkA7Y;e9UWZ3kkA7Y-8-rgb_front;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_7;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_7-8-rgb_front;43.29;48.86;O.k, in relationship to the wind coming from your back, we just covered what if the wind is coming to your face.;8;22
29818;e9UWZ3kkA7Y;e9UWZ3kkA7Y-8-rgb_front;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_8;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_8-8-rgb_front;49.25;53.87;O.k, we're going to use the same analogy, now, except now, it's going to be in reverse.;8;17
29819;e9UWZ3kkA7Y;e9UWZ3kkA7Y-8-rgb_front;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_9;e9UWZ3kkA7Y_9-8-rgb_front;54.18;64.22;This time to beat the wind coming against our back, we need to go low in our back cast, come up, and then go down in our forward cast.;8;29
29833;eAWErqR6vtQ;eAWErqR6vtQ-8-rgb_front;eAWErqR6vtQ_0;eAWErqR6vtQ_0-8-rgb_front;0.69;4.05;Here's a simple improve warm up exercise.;8;7
29834;eAWErqR6vtQ;eAWErqR6vtQ-8-rgb_front;eAWErqR6vtQ_1;eAWErqR6vtQ_1-8-rgb_front;4.05;5.88;Itâs a nice icebreaker for a group.;8;7
29835;eAWErqR6vtQ;eAWErqR6vtQ-8-rgb_front;eAWErqR6vtQ_11;eAWErqR6vtQ_11-8-rgb_front;45.47;49.92;So people are clapping, ding ding ding ding ding, around the circle and they're saying zip zap zop, zip zap zop.;8;21
29836;eAWErqR6vtQ;eAWErqR6vtQ-8-rgb_front;eAWErqR6vtQ_12;eAWErqR6vtQ_12-8-rgb_front;49.92;57.67;And you can see already I'm just going to flub it up when you're sort of zip zap zop zop zip and then you get to celebrate every time someone makes a mistake.;8;33
29837;eAWErqR6vtQ;eAWErqR6vtQ-8-rgb_front;eAWErqR6vtQ_13;eAWErqR6vtQ_13-8-rgb_front;58.13;60.28;So this is a game that should be played fast.;8;10
29838;eAWErqR6vtQ;eAWErqR6vtQ-8-rgb_front;eAWErqR6vtQ_14;eAWErqR6vtQ_14-8-rgb_front;60.28;66.13;If you're playing zip zap zop, zip..zap...you're doing something wrong.;8;10
29839;eAWErqR6vtQ;eAWErqR6vtQ-8-rgb_front;eAWErqR6vtQ_15;eAWErqR6vtQ_15-8-rgb_front;66.34;78.31;So you should play it fast enough that people are messing up and that the words are getting tripped up and focus people on making eye contact with each other and delivering the word straight to them.;8;37
29840;eAWErqR6vtQ;eAWErqR6vtQ-8-rgb_front;eAWErqR6vtQ_16;eAWErqR6vtQ_16-8-rgb_front;78.52;83.06;So that is the improv exercise Zip Zap Zop.;8;9
29841;eAWErqR6vtQ;eAWErqR6vtQ-8-rgb_front;eAWErqR6vtQ_2;eAWErqR6vtQ_2-8-rgb_front;5.92;8.36;Itâs called Zip Zap Zop.;8;5
29842;eAWErqR6vtQ;eAWErqR6vtQ-8-rgb_front;eAWErqR6vtQ_3;eAWErqR6vtQ_3-8-rgb_front;8.36;12.96;And one of the things itâs good at is its good for helping people mess up in front of each other.;8;21
29843;eAWErqR6vtQ;eAWErqR6vtQ-8-rgb_front;eAWErqR6vtQ_4;eAWErqR6vtQ_4-8-rgb_front;13.15;17.74;It causes for a lot of mistakes and that get people loosened up and just feeling goofy.;8;17
29844;eAWErqR6vtQ;eAWErqR6vtQ-8-rgb_front;eAWErqR6vtQ_5;eAWErqR6vtQ_5-8-rgb_front;17.97;20.46;So itâs a lot like the game Pass the Clap.;8;10
29845;eAWErqR6vtQ;eAWErqR6vtQ-8-rgb_front;eAWErqR6vtQ_6;eAWErqR6vtQ_6-8-rgb_front;20.55;31.96;You're going to get everybody in the circle and one person's going to make eye contact with someone else in the circle, and they're going to clap at them, at the same time they're going to say the word zip, zip, o.k.;8;42
29846;eAWErqR6vtQ;eAWErqR6vtQ-8-rgb_front;eAWErqR6vtQ_7;eAWErqR6vtQ_7-8-rgb_front;32.53;37.92;That person is going to look at somebody else and they're going to clap at them and they're going to say zap.;8;22
29847;eAWErqR6vtQ;eAWErqR6vtQ-8-rgb_front;eAWErqR6vtQ_8;eAWErqR6vtQ_8-8-rgb_front;38.36;40.9;That person's going to look at somebody else and say zop.;8;11

29918;eGLS5AY_TEw;eGLS5AY_TEw-8-rgb_front;eGLS5AY_TEw_0;eGLS5AY_TEw_0-8-rgb_front;0.72;4.97;Another drill that will help you with ball handling which I had to learn.;8;14

29923;eGLS5AY_TEw;eGLS5AY_TEw-8-rgb_front;eGLS5AY_TEw_5;eGLS5AY_TEw_5-8-rgb_front;45.76;58.38;So, when you're doing the figure 8 drill, you want to get to the point, where you can do it quicker and quicker and quicker and as you get quicker, you'll be a little bit better with handling the ball.;8;40
29924;eGLS5AY_TEw;eGLS5AY_TEw-8-rgb_front;eGLS5AY_TEw_6;eGLS5AY_TEw_6-8-rgb_front;58.74;67.12;Now you can go outside to in like this and get faster or you can reverse it.;8;17

29981;eJIeFdrw4hM;eJIeFdrw4hM-8-rgb_front;eJIeFdrw4hM_2;eJIeFdrw4hM_2-8-rgb_front;17.12;20.6;Well you say, how can I learn two hundred students names, or more?;8;13

29983;eJIeFdrw4hM;eJIeFdrw4hM-8-rgb_front;eJIeFdrw4hM_4;eJIeFdrw4hM_4-8-rgb_front;24.41;29.98;Obviously, the first one is name tags, which is my least favorite, but it's certainly an option.;8;17

30046;eKWP0Bql7g4;eKWP0Bql7g4-8-rgb_front;eKWP0Bql7g4_1;eKWP0Bql7g4_1-8-rgb_front;13.79;22.78;Because this descent coming up I've ridden before and I know it's pretty short, and I start going uphill after it, I probably am only going to change gears in the rear.;8;32

30048;eKWP0Bql7g4;eKWP0Bql7g4-8-rgb_front;eKWP0Bql7g4_3;eKWP0Bql7g4_3-8-rgb_front;33.45;38.78;So, one, two, three, shifts, and boom, I'm there.;8;9

30281;eYwnPtrnsWw;eYwnPtrnsWw-8-rgb_front;eYwnPtrnsWw_0;eYwnPtrnsWw_0-8-rgb_front;0.64;7.67;Hi I'm Laura Pace I'm here at Asel Art Supply today, I'm going to give you a lesson on how to draw hair with a pencil.;8;26
30282;eYwnPtrnsWw;eYwnPtrnsWw-8-rgb_front;eYwnPtrnsWw_1;eYwnPtrnsWw_1-8-rgb_front;8.8;11.59;I used a pretty soft pencil to do this drawing.;8;10

30284;eYwnPtrnsWw;eYwnPtrnsWw-8-rgb_front;eYwnPtrnsWw_11;eYwnPtrnsWw_11-8-rgb_front;93.42;105.35;And then the last thing I did is I left some individual hairs showing on the ends of her hair, some detail to give you an idea of the texture of her hair.;8;33
30285;eYwnPtrnsWw;eYwnPtrnsWw-8-rgb_front;eYwnPtrnsWw_12;eYwnPtrnsWw_12-8-rgb_front;107.49;124.42;Next I drew a girl with very light colored hair so when you are drawing with blond or white hair, you might even want to draw a shadow shape behind or around the head to give the edge of the hair some definition.;8;43
30286;eYwnPtrnsWw;eYwnPtrnsWw-8-rgb_front;eYwnPtrnsWw_13;eYwnPtrnsWw_13-8-rgb_front;125.43;135.87;We are going to kind of do the opposite of what we did on this girl with the dark hair here, because the line work on this hair is in the shadow areas.;8;33

30288;eYwnPtrnsWw;eYwnPtrnsWw-8-rgb_front;eYwnPtrnsWw_15;eYwnPtrnsWw_15-8-rgb_front;148.04;159.36;And I also drew some shadows around her face so that you can see that the mass of her hair is casting a shadow on to the edge of her face.;8;31
30289;eYwnPtrnsWw;eYwnPtrnsWw-8-rgb_front;eYwnPtrnsWw_16;eYwnPtrnsWw_16-8-rgb_front;160.19;166.38;The darker shadows in this hair are going to be on these rounded shapes at the bottom.;8;17

30293;eYwnPtrnsWw;eYwnPtrnsWw-8-rgb_front;eYwnPtrnsWw_2;eYwnPtrnsWw_2-8-rgb_front;11.86;16.25;This is a three B which makes a really soft black line.;8;12

30295;eYwnPtrnsWw;eYwnPtrnsWw-8-rgb_front;eYwnPtrnsWw_21;eYwnPtrnsWw_21-8-rgb_front;194.56;196.67;It doesn't have a lot of detail to it.;8;9

30297;eYwnPtrnsWw;eYwnPtrnsWw-8-rgb_front;eYwnPtrnsWw_23;eYwnPtrnsWw_23-8-rgb_front;209.47;229.56;On the top of the hair where the light hits, there's a little suggestion of texture here which I did by making spiral lines with my pencil and the outside edge of this hair have a tiny detail of rounded lines.;8;41
30298;eYwnPtrnsWw;eYwnPtrnsWw-8-rgb_front;eYwnPtrnsWw_24;eYwnPtrnsWw_24-8-rgb_front;229.96;236.82;Instead of just being a straight line I wanted to show the kinky texture of his hair by drawing rounded lines.;8;21

30303;eYwnPtrnsWw;eYwnPtrnsWw-8-rgb_front;eYwnPtrnsWw_4;eYwnPtrnsWw_4-8-rgb_front;25.66;32.01;Depending on how the person's face is turned because the hair really wraps around the skull.;8;16
30304;eYwnPtrnsWw;eYwnPtrnsWw-8-rgb_front;eYwnPtrnsWw_5;eYwnPtrnsWw_5-8-rgb_front;35.58;41.9;We want to draw the hair as masses of form rather then trying to draw individual hair.;8;17
30305;eYwnPtrnsWw;eYwnPtrnsWw-8-rgb_front;eYwnPtrnsWw_6;eYwnPtrnsWw_6-8-rgb_front;42.46;51.5;Individual hair drawing is pretty tedious and it really doesn't give you a good idea of what you are seeing when you look at a person's hair.;8;27
30306;eYwnPtrnsWw;eYwnPtrnsWw-8-rgb_front;eYwnPtrnsWw_7;eYwnPtrnsWw_7-8-rgb_front;52.46;56.3;So the first drawing I did here is a girl with very dark hair.;8;14
30307;eYwnPtrnsWw;eYwnPtrnsWw-8-rgb_front;eYwnPtrnsWw_8;eYwnPtrnsWw_8-8-rgb_front;57.14;66.23;And I have some mass areas that I made here that I just completely blacked in with my dark pencil.;8;20
30308;eYwnPtrnsWw;eYwnPtrnsWw-8-rgb_front;eYwnPtrnsWw_9;eYwnPtrnsWw_9-8-rgb_front;68.04;79.31;But you can also see I left some highlight light areas to show that she has kind of a sheen to her very dark straight hair.;8;26

30672;f6SJe6s7FBQ;f6SJe6s7FBQ-8-rgb_front;f6SJe6s7FBQ_13;f6SJe6s7FBQ_13-8-rgb_front;83.67;84.85;That's the big thing about it.;8;6

30674;f6SJe6s7FBQ;f6SJe6s7FBQ-8-rgb_front;f6SJe6s7FBQ_15;f6SJe6s7FBQ_15-8-rgb_front;88.01;95.72;But if it rains on it or you're kiting somewhere in the Great Lakes or somewhere where it's just fresh water, make sure when you put the kite away, you're putting away a dry kite.;8;35
30675;f6SJe6s7FBQ;f6SJe6s7FBQ-8-rgb_front;f6SJe6s7FBQ_16;f6SJe6s7FBQ_16-8-rgb_front;95.94;102.59;Because the next time you open your bag and pull out your kite, all of a sudden, you're going to find all this nasty mould wrapped around the entire thing.;8;30
