## Rafael Azevedo, Thiago Coutinho, Jo√£o Ferreira, Thiago Gomes, Erickson Nascimento

The goal of this repo is to provide a replicable script for the Graphics Replicability Stamp Initiative (GRSI) in order to show the reprodutibility of our results.

In order to facilitate executing our code, we provide a simple shell script that will build a docker container and run it to generate the required representative figure and also reproduce some of our results. More details can be found in the `build_docker` folder. Our source code can be found in the `code` folder.

Soon we should add complete code and instructions.
